@c
@c The reference checker is the GNU texi2any tool, which can be invoked like this:
@c   texi2any --plaintext --no-split --verbose Compilation.texi
@c
@c If you modify this file, you may want to spell-check it with:
@c    aspell --lang=en_GB --mode=texinfo check Compilation.texi
@c
@c The length of lines in this file is set to 100 because it tends to keep sentences together
@c despite the embedded @commands{};
@c
@c It is generally considered good practice for Tex and Texinfo formats to keep sentences on
@c different lines, using the fact that in the end they will be merged in paragraph anyway, because
@c it makes the patchs clearer about where the changes actually are.

@node Prerequisites
@chapter Prerequisites

@section Supported Platforms

@itemize -
@item Intel GNU/Linux Systems in general, @t{ix86} and @t{x86_64} but other architectures should work
@item BSD systems
@item Solaris, at least on release 10 and 11
@end itemize

Patches to make it work on other platforms are welcome.


@section Software Dependencies
@anchor{Software Dependencies}

The following software is required to use @sc{Window Maker}:
@itemize -
@item X11R6.x

Window Maker can be compiled in older versions of @emph{X}, like @emph{X11R5} (@emph{Solaris})
or @emph{X11R4} (@emph{OpenWindows}) but it will not work 100% correctly.
In such servers there will not be application icons and you'll have trouble using the dock.
Upgrading the client libraries (@emph{Xlib}, @emph{Xt}, etc.) will help if you can't upgrade
the server.
@end itemize

@noindent The following is required to build @sc{Window Maker}:
@itemize -
@item Basic obvious stuff

@itemize
@item @emph{gcc} (or some other ANSI C compiler, supporting some C99 extensions)
@item @emph{glibc} development files (usually @file{glibc-devel} in Linux distributions)
@item @emph{X} development files (@file{XFree86-devel} or something similar)
@end itemize

@item @emph{Xft2} and its dependencies

Dependencies include @emph{freetype2} and @emph{fontconfig}.
You will also need the development files for them (@file{xft2-devel}).
Sources are available at: @uref{http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xft/}

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Note}:
@sc{Window Maker} is known to compile with @emph{gcc} and @emph{clang};
the code source is mostly ANSI C (also known as C89 and C90) but is uses very few of the C99
novelties;
it also uses a few attributes introduced in the C11 standard but those are detected automatically,
so most compilers should work.


@section Special Dependencies
@anchor{Special Dependencies}


If you want to compile using the sources from the git repository instead of the distribution
package, you will also need:
@itemize
@item @emph{git}
@item @emph{autoconf} 2.69
@item @emph{automake} 1.12
@item @emph{libtool} 1.4.2
@end itemize


@section Optional Dependencies
@anchor{Optional Dependencies}

These libraries are not required to make @sc{Window Maker} work, but they are supported in case you
want to use them. Version numbers are indicative, but other versions might work too.

@itemize -
@item @emph{libXPM} 4.7 or newer

Older versions may not work!

Available from @uref{http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/}

There is built-in support for @emph{XPM} files, but it will not
load images in some uncommon encodings.

@item @emph{libpng} 0.96 or newer and @emph{zlib}

For @emph{PNG} image support,
@uref{http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html}

@item @emph{libtiff} 3.4 or newer

For @emph{TIFF} image support,
@uref{http://www.libtiff.org/}

@item @emph{libjpeg} 6.0.1 or newer

For @emph{JPEG} image support,
@uref{http://www.ijg.org/}

Note that if you don't have it, @command{configure} will issue a big warning in the end,
this is because JPEG images are often used in themes and for background images
so you probably want this format supported.

@item @emph{libgif} 2.2 or @emph{libungif}

For @emph{GIF} image support,
@uref{http://giflib.sourceforge.net/}

@item @emph{WebP} 0.4.1 or newer

The reference library from @emph{Google} for their image format,
@uref{https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download}

@item @emph{GNU xgettext}

If you want to use translated messages, you will need @emph{GNU gettext}.
Other versions of @emph{gettext} are not compatible and will not work.
Get the @emph{GNU} version from @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/}

@item @emph{Pango} 1.36.8 or newer

This library can be used by the @emph{WINGs} toolkit to improve support for @emph{UTF-8} and for
languages written in right-to-left direction, in some widgets.
You have to explicitly ask for its support through (@pxref{Configure Options}).
You can get it from @uref{http://www.pango.org/Download}

@item @emph{libbsd}

This library can be used by the @emph{WINGs} utility library to make use of @command{strlcat} and
@command{strlcpy} instead of using built-in functions if your system does not provide them in its
core @emph{libc}.
You should let @sc{Window Maker}'s @command{configure} detect this for you.
You can get it from @uref{http://libbsd.freedesktop.org/wiki/}

@item @emph{Inotify}

If you have Linux's @emph{inotify} support, @sc{Window Maker} will use it to check for configuration
updates instead of polling regularly the file.
The needed header comes with the kernel, typical packages names include:
@itemize
@item @file{kernel-headers} for @emph{Slackware} and @emph{Fedora}
@item @file{linux-userspace-headers} for @emph{Mageia}
@item @file{linux-libc-dev} for @emph{Debian} and @emph{Ubuntu}
@item @file{linux-glibc-devel} for @emph{OpenSuSE}
@end itemize

@item @emph{MagickWand} 6.8.9-9 or newer

If found, then the library @emph{WRaster} can use the @emph{ImageMagick} library to let
@sc{Window Maker} support more image formats, like @emph{SVG}, @emph{BMP}, @emph{TGA}, ...
You can get it from @uref{http://www.imagemagick.org/}

@item @emph{Boehm GC}

This library can be used by the @emph{WINGs} utility toolkit to use a
@cite{Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector} instead of the traditional
@command{malloc}/@command{free} functions from the @emph{libc}.
You have to explicitly ask for its support though (@pxref{Configure Options}).
You can get it from @uref{http://www.hboehm.info/gc/}

@end itemize


@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Building Window Maker ---
@node Building Window Maker
@chapter Building @sc{Window Maker}

@section Getting the Sources

The latest version of @sc{Window Maker} (@t{-crm}) can be downloaded from
@uref{http://www.windowmaker.org/}

Alternatively, the development branch, called @t{#next} is in the @emph{git} repository at
@uref{http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git}

If you want to use the @emph{git} versions, you can get it with:
@example
git clone -b next git://repo.or.cz/wmaker-crm.git
@end example
@noindent then, assuming you have the dependencies listed in @ref{Special Dependencies}, you have to
type:
@example
./autogen.sh
@end example
@noindent to generate the configuration script.


@section Build and Install

For a quick start, type the following in your shell prompt:

@example
./configure
make
@end example

@noindent then, login as @emph{root} and type:

@example
make install
ldconfig
@end example

@noindent or if you want to strip the debugging symbols from the binaries to make them smaller,
you can type instead:

@example
make install-strip
ldconfig
@end example

@noindent This will build and install @sc{Window Maker} with default parameters.

If you want to customise some compile-time options, you can do the following:

@enumerate
@item
(optional) Look at the @ref{Configure Options}, for the options available.
Also run:
@example
./configure --help
@end example

to get a complete list of options that are available.

@item
Run configure with the options you want.
For example, if you want to use the @option{--enable-modelock} option, type:
@example
./configure --enable-modelock
@end example

@item
(optional) Edit @file{src/wconfig.h} with your favourite text editor and browse through it for some
options you might want to change.

@item
Compile. Just type:
@example
make
@end example

@item
Login as root (if you can't do that, read the @ref{No Root Password, , I don't have the @emph{root} password})
and install @sc{Window Maker} in your system:
@example
su root
make install
@end example

@end enumerate


@section User specific configuration

These instructions do not need to be followed when upgrading @sc{Window Maker}
from an older version, unless stated differently in the @cite{NEWS} file.

Every user on your system that wishes to run @sc{Window Maker} must do the
following:

@enumerate
@item
Install Window Maker configuration files in your home directory.
Type:
@example
wmaker.inst
@end example

@command{wmaker.inst} will install @sc{Window Maker} configuration files and will
setup X to automatically launch @sc{Window Maker} at startup.

@end enumerate

That's it!

You can type @command{man wmaker} to get some general help for configuration
and other stuff.

Read the @cite{User Guide} for a more in-depth explanation of @sc{Window Maker}.

You might want to take a look at the @cite{FAQ} too.


@section Locales/Internationalisation

@sc{Window Maker} has national language support. The procedure to enable national
language support is described in the dedicated
@ref{Enabling Languages support,,,wmaker_i18n,@file{README.i18n}}.


@section Configure Options
@anchor{Configure Options}

These options can be passed to the configure script to enable/disable
some @sc{Window Maker} features. Example:
@example
./configure --enable-modelock --disable-gif
@end example
will configure @sc{Window Maker} with @emph{modelock} supported and disable @emph{gif} support.
Normally, you won't need any of them.

To get the list of all options, run @command{./configure --help}


@subsection Installation Directory

The default installation path will be in the @file{/usr/local} hierarchy;
a number of option can customise this:

@table @option
@item  --prefix=@i{PREFIX}
@itemx --exec-prefix=@i{EPREFIX}
@itemx --bindir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --sysconfdir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --libdir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --includedir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --datarootdir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --datadir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --localedir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --mandir=@i{DIR}
Standard options from @emph{autoconf} to define target paths,
you probably want to read @ref{Installation Names,,,INSTALL,@file{INSTALL}}.

@item  --sbindir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --libexecdir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --sharedstatedir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --localstatedir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --oldincludedir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --infodir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --docdir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --htmldir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --dvidir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --pdfdir=@i{DIR}
@itemx --psdir=@i{DIR}
More standard options from @emph{autoconf}, today these are not used by @sc{Window Maker};
they are provided automatically by @emph{autoconf} for consistency.

@item --with-gnustepdir=@i{PATH}
Specific to @sc{Window Maker}, defines the directory where @file{WPrefs.app} will be installed,
if you want to install it like a @emph{GNUstep} applications.
If not specified, it will be installed like usual programs.

@item --with-pixmapdir=@i{DIR}
Specific to @sc{Window Maker}, this option defines an additional path where @emph{pixmaps} will be
searched. Nothing will be installed there; the default path taken is @file{@emph{DATADIR}/pixmaps},
where @var{DATADIR} is the path defined from @option{--datadir}.

@end table


@subsection External Libraries

Unless specifically written, @command{configure} will try to detect automatically for the libraries;
if you explicitly provide @option{--enable-@emph{FEATURE}} then it will break with an error message
if the library cannot be linked;
if you specify @option{--disable-@emph{FEATURE}} then it will not try to search for the library.
You can find more information about the libraries in the
@ref{Optional Dependencies}.

@table @option
@item --enable-boehm-gc
Never enabled by default, use Boehm GC instead of the default @emph{libc} @command{malloc()}

@item --disable-gif
Disable GIF support in @emph{WRaster} library; when enabled use @file{libgif} or @file{libungif}.

@item --disable-jpeg
Disable JPEG support in @emph{WRaster} library; when enabled use @file{libjpeg}.

@item --without-libbsd
Refuse use of the @file{libbsd} compatibility library in @emph{WINGs} utility library,
even if your system provides it.

@item --disable-magick
Disable @emph{ImageMagick's MagickWand} support in @emph{WRaster}, used to support for image formats.

@item --enable-pango
Disabled by default, enable @emph{Pango} text layout support in @emph{WINGs}.

@item --disable-png
Disable PNG support in @emph{WRaster}; when enabled use @file{libpng}.

@item --disable-tiff
Disable TIFF support in @emph{WRaster}. when enabled use @file{libtiff}.

@item --disable-webp
Disable WEBP support in @emph{WRaster}. when enabled use @file{libwebp}.

@item --disable-xpm
Disable use of @file{libXpm} for XPM support in @emph{WRaster}, use internal code instead.

@end table

The following options can be used to tell @command{configure} about extra paths that needs to be
used when compiling against libraries:

@table @option
@item --with-libs-from
specify additional paths for libraries to be searched.
The @option{-L} flag must precede each path, like:
@example
--with-libs-from="-L/opt/libs -L/usr/local/lib"
@end example

@item --with-incs-from
specify additional paths for header files to be searched.
The @option{-I} flag must precede each paths, like:
@example
--with-incs-from="-I/opt/headers -I/usr/local/include"
@end example

@end table


@subsection X11 and Extensions

@command{configure} will try to detect automatically the compilation paths for X11 headers and
libraries, and which X Extensions support can be enabled.
if you explicitly provide @option{--enable-@emph{FEATURE}} then it will break with an error message
if the extension cannot be used;
if you specify @option{--disable-@emph{FEATURE}} then it will not check for the extension.

@table @option
@item  --x-includes=@i{DIR}
@itemx --x-libraries=@i{DIR}
@emph{Autoconf}'s option to specify search paths for @emph{X11},
for the case were it would not have been able to detect it automatically.

@item --disable-xlocale
If you activated support for Native Languages, then @emph{X11} may use a hack to also configure its
locale support when the program configure the locale for itself.
The @command{configure} script detects if the @emph{Xlib} supports this or not;
this options explicitly disable this initialisation mechanism.

@item --enable-modelock
XKB language status lock support. If you don't know what it is you probably don't need it.
The default is to not enable it.

@item --disable-shm
Disable use of the @emph{MIT shared memory} extension.
This will slow down texture generation a little bit, but in some cases it seems to be necessary due
to a bug that manifests as messed icons and textures.

@item --disable-shape
Disables support for @emph{shaped} windows (for @command{oclock}, @command{xeyes}, etc.).

@item --enable-xinerama
The @emph{Xinerama} extension provides information about the different screens connected when
running a multi-head setting (if you plug more than one monitor).

@item --enable-randr
The @emph{RandR} extension provides feedback when changing the multiple-monitor configuration in X11
and allows to re-configure how screens are organised.

At current time, it is not enabled by default because it is NOT recommended (buggy);
@sc{Window Maker} only restart itself when the configuration change, to take into account the new
screen size.

@end table


@subsection Feature Selection

@table @option
@item --disable-animations
Disable animations permanently, by not compiling the corresponding code into @sc{Window Maker}.
When enabled (the default), you still have a run-time configuration option in @emph{WPrefs}.

@item --disable-mwm-hints
Disable support for Motif's MWM Window Manager hints.
These attributes were introduced by the Motif toolkit to ask for special window appearance requests.
Nowadays this is covered by the NetWM/EWMH specification, but there are still applications that rely on MWM Hints.

@item --enable-wmreplace
Add support for the @emph{ICCCM} protocol for cooperative window manager replacement.
This feature is disabled by default because you probably don't need to switch seamlessly the window manager;
if you are making a package for a distribution you'd probably want to enable this because it allows users to give
a try to different window managers without restarting everything for an extra cost that is not really big.

@item --disable-xdnd
Disable support for dragging and dropping files on the dock, which launches a user-specified command
with that file.
Starting from version 0.65.6 this feature is enabled by default.

@item --enable-ld-version-script
This feature is auto-detected, and you should not use this option.
When compiling a library (@file{wrlib}, ...), @emph{gcc} has the possibility to filter the list of
functions that will be visible, to keep only the public API, because it helps running programs
faster.

The @command{configure} script checks if this feature is available;
if you specify this option it will not check anymore and blindly trust you that it is supposed to
work, which is not a good idea as you may encounter problems later when compiling.

@item --enable-usermenu
This feature, disabled by default, allows to add a user-defined custom menu to applications;
when choosing an entry of the menu it will send the key combination defined by the user to that
application. @xref{Application User Menu,,,NEWS,@file{NEWS}} for more information.

@item --with-menu-textdomain=@i{DOMAIN}
Selection of the domain used for translation of the menus;
@pxref{Translations for Menus,,,wmaker_i18n,@file{README.i18n}}.

@end table


@subsection Developer Stuff

These options are disabled by default:

@table @option
@item --config-cache
If you intend to re-run the @command{configure} script often, you probably want to include this
option, so it will save and re-use the status of what have been detected in the file
@file{config.cache}.

@item --enable-debug
Enable debugging features (debug symbol, some extra verbosity and checks) and add a number of
check flags (warnings) for the compiler (in @emph{gcc} fashion).

@item --enable-lcov=@i{DIRECTORY}
Enable generation of code coverage and profiling data;
if the @file{@i{DIRECTORY}} is not specified, use @file{coverage-report}.

This option was meant to be use with @emph{gcc};
it was not used recently so it is probable that is does not work anymore;
the @command{configure} script will not even check that your compiling environment has the
appropriate requirements and works with this.
Despite all this, if you think there's a use for it and feel in the mood to help, do not hesitate to
discuss on the mailing list @value{emailsupport} to get it working.

@end table

@node Miscellaneous
@chapter Miscellaneous

@section Platform Specific Notes

@itemize -
@item @emph{GNU/Linux} in general

Make sure you have @file{/usr/local/lib} in @file{/etc/ld.so.conf} and that you
run @command{ldconfig} after installing.
Uninstall any packaged version of @sc{Window Maker} before installing a new version.

@item @emph{RedHat GNU/Linux}

@emph{RedHat} systems have several annoying problems.
If you use it, be sure to follow the steps below or @sc{Window Maker} will not work:

@itemize
@item
if you installed the @sc{Window Maker} that comes with @emph{RedHat}, uninstall it before upgrading;

@item
make sure you have @file{/usr/local/bin} in your @env{PATH} environment variable;

@item
make sure you have @file{/usr/local/lib} in @file{/etc/ld.so.conf} before running @command{ldconfig};
@end itemize

@item @emph{PowerPC MkLinux}

You will need to have the latest version of @emph{Xpmac}.
Older versions seem to have bugs that cause the system to hang.

@item @emph{Debian GNU/Linux}

If you want @emph{JPEG} and @emph{TIFF} support, make sure you have @file{libtiff-dev}
and @file{libjpeg-dev} installed.

@item @emph{SuSE GNU/Linux}

If you installed the @sc{Window Maker} package from @emph{SuSE}, uninstall it before trying to
compile @emph{Window Maker} or you might have problems.

@item @emph{MetroX} (unknown version)

@emph{MetroX} has a bug that corrupts pixmaps that are set as window backgrounds.
If you use @emph{MetroX} and have weird problems with textures, do not use textures in title bars.
Or use a different X server.

@end itemize


@section I don't have the @emph{root} password :(
@anchor{No Root Password}

If you can't get superuser privileges (can't be @i{root}) you can install @emph{Window Maker} in your own
home directory.
For that, supply the @option{--prefix} option when running configure in step 2 of building
@sc{Window Maker}.
You will also need to supply the @option{--with-gnustepdir} option, to specify the path for
@command{WPrefs.app}.
Example:

@example
./configure --prefix=/home/jshmoe --with-gnustepdir=/home/jshmoe/GNUstep/Applications
@end example

Then make @file{/home/jshmoe/bin} be included in your search @env{PATH}, add @file{/home/jshmoe/lib}
to your @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment variable and run @command{bin/wmaker.inst}

Of course, @file{/home/jshmoe} is supposed to be replaced by your actual home directory path.


@section Upgrading

If you are upgrading from an older version of @sc{Window Maker}:

@enumerate
@item Configure and build @sc{Window Maker} as always
@item Install @sc{Window Maker} (but do not run @command{wmaker.inst})
@item Read the @cite{NEWS} file and update your configuration files if necessary.
@end enumerate


@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Miscelleanous ---
@node Troubleshooting
@chapter Troubleshooting

When you have some trouble during configuration (while running configure), like not being able to
use a graphic format library you think you have installed, look at the @file{config.log} file for
clues of the problem.


@section Error with loading fonts, even if they exist

This is probably a problem with NLS (Native Language Support), you probably want to look at the
@ref{Troubleshooting,,,wmaker_i18n,@file{README.i18n}}
or try rebuilding without NLS support, which is done with:
@example
./configure LINGUAS=""
@end example


@section configure doesn't detect @emph{libtiff}, or other graphic libraries

Delete @file{config.cache}, then rerun configure adding the following options to @command{configure}
(among the other options you use):
@example
--with-libs-from="-L/usr/local/lib"
--with-incs-from="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/tiff"
@end example
Put the paths where your graphic libs and their corresponding header files are located.
You can put multiple paths in any of these options, as the example of @option{--with-incs-from} shows.
Just put a space between them.


@section configure doesn't detect @emph{libXpm}

Check if you have a symbolic link from @file{libXpm.so.4.9} to @file{libXpm.so}


@section Segmentation fault on startup

@itemize
@item Check if the version of @emph{libXPM} you have is at least 4.7

@item Check if you have an updated version of @file{~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker}
@end itemize

If you're not sure, try renaming @file{~/GNUstep} to @file{~/GNUtmp}
and then run @command{wmaker.inst}


@section "...: your machine is misconfigured. gethostname() returned (none)"

the host name of your machine is set to something invalid, that starts with a parenthesis.
Do a @command{man hostname} for info about how to set it.


@section The root menu contains only 2 entries. ("XTerm" and "Exit...")

@sc{Window Maker} could not read your menu definition file.
You should check the output of @command{wmaker} for an error, it may be visible in the console or in the
@file{.xsession-errors} file.


@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The End ---
