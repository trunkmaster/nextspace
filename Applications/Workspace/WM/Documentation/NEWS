NEWS for veteran Window Maker users
-----------------------------------

-- 0.95.7

Window snapping
---------------

You can now "snap" a window, i.e., maximize it to a side or corner of the
screen, by dragging it to that side or corner.  It is enabled by setting
"WindowSnapping = YES" in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker or selecting "Maximize
(snap) a window to edge or corner by dragging." under "Expert User Preferences"
in WPrefs.app.

Note that if "Switch workspaces while dragging windows" is selected under
"Workspace Preferences" in WPrefs.app, or if "DontLinkWorkspaces = NO" in
~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker, then you may only snap a window to the top or
bottom of the screen.

You may set the distance (in pixels) from the edge or corner of the screen at
which a window will begin snapping using "SnapEdgeDetect" and "SnapCornerDetect"
in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker or setting "Distance from edge/corner to begin
window snap." under "Expert User Preferences" in WPrefs.app.  (The defaults are
1 pixel and 10 pixels, respectively).


Dragging maximized windows
--------------------------
You can now control the behavior when a maximized window is dragged by setting
the "DragMaximizedWindow" option in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker or by
selecting an option from the "When dragging a maximized window..." pop-up button
under "Window Handling Preferences" in WPrefs.app.

There are four choices:
* "Move" ("...change position (normal behavior)" in WPrefs.app) is the default
  and traditional behavior.  A maximized window is moved when dragged and
  remains maximized, i.e., it keeps its maximized geometry and can later be
  unmaximized.
* "RestoreGeometry" ("...restore unmaximized geometry") is the behavior standard
  in desktop environments like GNOME, Cinnamon, and Unity.  A maximized window
  is moved when dragged and is completely unmaximized, i.e., its unmaximized
  geometry is restored.
* "Unmaximize" ("...consider the window unmaximized") causes a maximized window
  to be moved when dragged and remains partially maximized, i.e., it keeps its
  maximized geometry, but is consider to be unmaximized.  In particular, it can
  be immediately re-maximized.
* "NoMove" ("...do not move the window") prevents a maximized window from being
  moved when dragged.

Note that, to accomodate this option in the "Window Handling Preferences" tab in
WPrefs.app, the option to "Open dialogs in the same workspace as their owners"
(which sets the "OpenTransientOnOwnerWorkspace" option from
~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker) has been moved to "Expert User Preferences".


Mini-Previews instead of Apercus
--------------------------------

Since the original name was not really clear because it is a French word that
is rarely used by British people, it was decided to change it to the more usual
Mini-Preview name. The setting is configurable with WPrefs in the Icon
Preferences tab, the size is now expressed in pixels directly.


Ignore Decoration Hints from GNOME applications
-----------------------------------------------

The GNOME applications ask Window Maker to get no title bar and no resize bar to
their windows by using "Hints". You can re-add them using the Attribute dialog
in the Window menu, but if you are using many GNOME applications you may want to
tell Window Maker to just ignore them. This is done with the new setting called
"IgnoreGtkHints", which is available in the "Expert" panel in WPrefs.


Cooperative Window Manager Replacement
--------------------------------------

The ICCCM defines a protocol for window managers to ask to replace the currently
running one; Window Maker now supports it. You can ask Window Maker to take the
place of current one by running "wmaker --replace", or any other window manager
can ask Window Maker to leave the place for them when started the same way.
Please note that this feature must be explicitely enabled at compile time because
by default it is not compiled in ("configure --enable-wmreplace").


--- 0.95.6

More image format supported
---------------------------

In addition to a more complete Netpbm image formats support, WindowMaker
can now load WebP images. It can also make use of the ImageMagick library
to support a lot more formats, like SVG, BMP, TGA...


Mini-window apercu
------------------

A small preview of window contents can be enabled from WPrefs,
in Miscellaneous Ergonomic Preferences, check miniwindow apercus.
Apercu size can be configured using the ApercuSize variable with

$ wdwrite WindowMaker ApercuSize 4

in multiples of the icon size (in this case the apercu size will be four
times the icon size).

The default size is 2 (twice the icon size).


Support for up to 9-buttons mouse
---------------------------------

The action for the newly supported buttons can be configured from WPrefs.


wmiv, an image viewer application
---------------------------------

wmiv is a quick image viewer using wrlib to be run from the command line.


--- 0.95.5

Support for generated menus in proplist format
----------------------------------------------

The root menu now supports a OPEN_PLMENU option to construct a submenu from
the output of a command which is proplist format. This can be used e.g. in
conjunction with wmmenugen like:

(
    "Generated PL Submenu", OPEN_PLMENU,
    "|| find /usr/share/applications -type f -name '*desktop' | xargs wmmenugen -parser:xdg"
)


New window placements
---------------------

Now it is possible to maximize windows to the top/bottom halves
of the screen and also to the corners (top/bottom + left/right).

The keyboard shortcuts can be configured with WPrefs.


Options to configure window/menu borders
----------------------------------------

You can now configure the width and color of window and menu borders.
For example, the default settings could be configured as follows:

$ wdwrite WindowMaker FrameBorderWidth 1
$ wdwrite WindowMaker FrameBorderColor black
$ wdwrite WindowMaker FrameSelectedBorderColor white


Keyboard shortcuts to move windows between workspaces
-----------------------------------------------------

You can now bind keyboard shortcuts - or use the window dropdown menus -
to move windows to other workspaces.  You can either move a window directly to
a particular workspace or to the "next" or "previous" workspace.

The new shortcuts can be configured in WPrefs.


Native support for Drawers
--------------------------

WindowMaker now supports drawers in the dock natively. You can add a dock by
right-clicking on a docked appicon and select "Add a drawer". You can now drag
appicons to this drawer.
You can customize how you want your drawers to auto-expand/collapse and
auto-raise/lower, or you can also completely disable them.


Improved switch panel functionality
-----------------------------------

The switch panel can be used to switch between windows of the same WM_CLASS,
for example between all open xterms.  If the switch panel is opened as normal
with either the "FocusNextKey" or "FocusPrevKey" shortcut, you can switch to
the next (or previous) window of the same type as the focused window with the
"GroupNextKey" or "GroupPrevKey" shortcut.  If the switch panel is opened with
the "GroupNextKey" or "GroupPrevKey" shortcut, it will show only windows of
the same type as the window which was focused at the time the panel was opened,
and no difference will be seen between the two types of window selection
shortcut.

The new shortcuts can be configured in WPrefs, where they are described as
allowing switching between windows of the same group.

To maintain consistency with other popular operating systems, the switch panel
is now configured so that it no longer automatically closes when the shift key
is pressed and released.

To configure the switch panel so that it does close on release of the shift
key, which was the traditional Window Maker behavior, run the following
command:

$ wdwrite WindowMaker StrictWindozeCycling NO

If you find yourself regularly opening the switch panel just to visualize open
windows, you can run the following command to force the first "FocusNextKey"
or similar shortcut to open the panel without switching to a new window.

$ wdwrite WindowMaker SwitchPanelOnlyOpen YES


--- 0.95.4

New window placement strategy
-----------------------------

Among the window placement algorithms has arrived the "center" placement to
get new windows appear at the center of the screen (unless application
explicitly specify a position, of course).


Removed dependency to CPP
-------------------------

The menu files used to be pre-processed with CPP, which can be a problem because
modern system do not install dev tools by default, and some compilers do not
provide a pre-processor anyway. WindowMaker is now autonomous.


--- 0.95.3

The references to the legacy path /usr/X11R6 have been removed because xorg
does not use it in favor of a standard /usr layout. Similarly, the directory
/etc/X11/WindowMaker is now /usr/share/WindowMaker.


New application Relaunching functionality
-----------------------------------------

There are now several ways to launch a new instance of an application with the
same command line that was originally used to start it.

1. By selecting Launch from the application's window menu.
2. By using the "Launch new instance of application" keyboard shortcut.
3. By clicking the application's appicon with the middle button.
4. By double-clicking the application's appicon while holding Control.

For example, if you have two xterms open, one started with "xterm" and one
started with "xterm -rv", using the Relaunch functionality on the first xterm
would run "xterm" and using it on the second would run "xterm -rv".  Thus
Relaunching can also be thought of as "cloning" an application.

Application Relaunching works by examining the window's WM_COMMAND property and
so will not work if it is not set.


Options to limit the window/menu title height
---------------------------------------------

You can now set the minimum and maximum titlebar heights.
For example, to force all titlebars to 24 pixels execute
the following commands:

$ wdwrite WindowMaker WindowTitleMinHeight 24
$ wdwrite WindowMaker WindowTitleMaxHeight 24
$ wdwrite WindowMaker MenuTitleMinHeight 24
$ wdwrite WindowMaker MenuTitleMaxHeight 24


--- 0.95.2

New Resizing functionality
--------------------------

You can now use the mouse wheel and modifier keys to resize windows.
MOD+Wheel will resize windows vertically and CTRL+Wheel will resize
windows horizontally. MOD+CTRL+Wheel will resize both at the same time.
The resize step, or increment can be set in WPrefs in the "Window Handling"
page, or in the config file with "ResizeIncrement". If this intrudes into
a specific application's functionality, you can disable it on an application-
by-application basis by setting the "Do not bind mouse clicks" attribute in
"Advanced Options".

New Maximize functionality
--------------------------

Maximus/Maximumize. A new tiled maximization, configured with a keyboard
shortcut. Using it will maximize the window to the greatest area such that it
will not overlap any other window of the same workspace. This can be configured
in WPrefs in the "Keyboard Shortcuts" page, or in the config file with
"MaximusKey".

Left/right maximization. Now wmaker supports maximizing a window to the
left or right half of the screen, making it occupy 50% of the area. This is
useful on wide screen displays where you want to bring up two windows side-by-
side. The shortcut keys for this can be configured in WPrefs in the "Keyboard
Shortcuts" page, or in the config file with "LHMaximizeKey" and "RHMaximizeKey"

History and AutoComplete in the run dialog
------------------------------------------

The "Run..." dialog now auto-completes executables in your path (triggered by
the TAB key) and records the history of past commands (last 500 by default).
It can also complete folder names if you start the complete with a "/"
To use it replace %a with %A in the "Run..." entry in your WMRootMenu file.
See commit 05720d97076ffc1569e5 for more details.

Automatic menu generator (wmgenmenu)
-----------------------------------

There is now a new utility to generate the Window Maker menu automatically,
called wmgenmenu. It searches from a list of pre-defined applications the
ones which exist in your $PATH and adds them to the corresponding submenus
("Internet", "Terminals", "Editors" etc) of your WM menu. It also supports
localization (currently English and German). You can use it like:

$ wmgenmenu > WMRootMenu-new
$ cp WMRootMenu-new $HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WMRootMenu

and WM will automatically detect the new menu file and use it without
restarting wmaker (made possible by the 'inotify' mechanism)

Automatic detection of menu changes (via inotify)
-------------------------------------------------

Window Maker now uses the 'inotify' mechanism from the Linux kernel
to automatically detect changes in the WMRootMenu file. So the
--no-polling option is now gone and Window Maker does not wake up
your CPU unnecessarily (0 wakeups when idle, instead of 4).
So if you edit the WMRootMenu file by hand (or by using 'wmgenmenu'),
there is no need to restart wmaker for the changes to take effect.

DockApp recognition
-------------------

In addition to applications with only Withdrawn windows, Window Maker
will now treat any application with its WM_CLASS res_class set as
"DockApp". This provides an easy workaround for toolkits like gtk+ that
do not allow creation of windows with the initial_state member of
XWMHints set to WithdrawnState.


--- 0.92.0

GNUstep Installation Directory
------------------------------

WPrefs is now installed in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share by default.
If you use GNUstep and want it to install in /usr/GNUstep/Applications,
you may specify --with-gnustepdir=/usr/GNUstep
If the GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT environment variable is defined when configure is
executed, it will be used (and you don't need to use --with-gnustepdir)

Cached Pixmaps Directory
------------------------

The directory where Window Maker stores the cached application pixmaps for
its later use has changed from ~/GNUstep/.AppInfo/WindowMaker to
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/CachedPixmaps for better compatibility with
the GNUstep path structure.
Also WPrefs now stores internal data in ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/WPrefs
(it was ~/GNUstep/.AppInfo/WPrefs before)

X Input Methods support in WINGs
--------------------------------

Preliminary support for X Input Methods was added to textfield and text
widgets in WINGs. Input for text in other languages than English should
work now (except for kanji which will most likely not work, even though
it wasn't tested).


Disabling the switch panel
--------------------------

To disable the panel shown during Alt-tabbing, you may put the following in
~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker

SwitchPanelImages= None;



--- 0.91.0

Alt-Tab Window Switching
------------------------

You can change the appearance of the panel shown during Alt-Tab window switching
with the SwitchPanelImages option:

 (selected_icon_tile_image, background_image, width, height)

selected_icon_tile_image is the image used to highlight the currently selected
window icon. It must be 64x64 pixels.

background_image is the image used in the background of the panel. It must
be at least 64x80.

width and height are the width and size of the central part of the image.
When drawing the panel, the image will be split as:
                           |W |
			+--+--+--+
			|  |  |  |
			+--+--+--+ -
			|  |  |  | H
			+--+--+--+ -
			|  |  |  |
			+--+--+--+

The 4 corner images will be copied in their original sizes and the rest will
be scaled to the final panel size.

background_image, width and height are optional. If you leave them out,
a gray panel will be used. If your machine is not very fast, you may want 
to use it.


--- 0.90.0


NetWM / EWMH Support
--------------------

Support for the EWMH standard has been added. Applications from GNOME 2.x and
KDE 3.x should now inter-operate better with Window Maker.

Support for the obsolete/legacy GNOME 1.x, KDE 1.x and OpenLook(!) hints was
wiped out for the sake of sanity.


Antialiased font support
------------------------

With the addition of Xft2 support in the WINGs library, now
Window Maker can display antialiased text with TrueType or any scalable fonts.

You can pick fonts for Window Maker in the Font configuration section of 
WPrefs.

Antialiased text is enabled by default, but can be disabled by adding

AntialiasedText = NO; in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMGLOBAL

This will disable antialiased text for any WINGs based application. If you
only want to disable them for a specific application only, like WindowMaker
for example, then add the same option in the applications configuration file,
in this case ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker
For WindowMaker, this can also be achieved from the Expert panel in WPrefs.

Note that bitmapped fonts look much better than TrueType when antialiasing is
disabled.

Global Submenus
---------------

Global menus allow for system wide menus that are added to every users
application menus. They are located in /usr/etc/WindowMaker/,
/usr/local/etc/WindowMaker or whatever is your sysconf directory
for WindowMaker. There are 2 files:

GlobalMenu.pre, which is added to the beginning of the menu and
GlobalMenu.post, which is added to the end of the menu.

These are to be proplist format menus, for example:

(("Foobar", EXEC, foobar),
 ("Blabla", EXEC, blabla))

or, in case you want a submenu:

(("Submenu", 
	("Foobar", EXEC, foobar),
	("Blabla", EXEC, blabla)))


UTF-8 Support
-------------

Window Maker now uses UTF-8 internally (and thus can display UTF-8 text
in window titles and other places). Menus and po files must now be
encoded in UTF-8. If your menus contain non ASCII characters, you can convert
them to UTF-8 with the following command:

iconv -f <current-file-encoding> -t utf-8 <filename> > <filename>.utf8

For example:

iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 menu > menu.utf
mv menu.utf menu


Icon Panel for Alt-Tabbing
--------------------------

A panel with icons for the windows that you can switch to will appear
when you press Alt-Tab. You can navigate through the windows with Alt-Tab
(Alt-Shift-Tab) or with the left/right keys once the panel is shown.



--- 0.80.0

Shading/Unshading windows using mouse wheel on their titlebar
-------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the known methods of shading/unshading a window,  one can now
do this by using the mouse wheel on the window's titlebar. The mouse events
are interpreted via a mapping in the global WINGs configuration file,
WMGLOBAL, by the MouseWheelUp and MouseWheelDown directives which will do
shading and unshading respectfully.

However, to avoid unwanted triggers of shading/unshading the window, two
consecutive mouse wheel events in the same direction are required. The
trigger won't occur if the events are separated by more than a double-click's 
worth of time, which is technically speaking like making a double-click with
the button that corresponds to the mouse wheel direction.

Practically speaking, this means that you have to move the mouse wheel up
or down quickly, like when you want to quickly scroll over something big.


Shared application icons
------------------------

Real application icon sharing was implemented in place of the collapse
appicon thing. With this applications of the same instance.class will
have a single shared application icon and hiding will hide all windows
of the application attached to that appicon as if there is a single
application. This feature is enabled by default for all applications in
the global WMWindowAttributes defaults domain using:

"*" = {SharedAppIcon = Yes;};

If you're not satisfied with this or want the old behavior back you
can revert this (either in the global domain for all users or in your
personal WMWindowAttibutes domain) using SharedAppIcon = No; for "*"
It can also be enabled/disabled for individual applications as needed.

Setting this option can be done using the window's inspector panel in the
"Application Specific" section. You can set/unset it for all applications by
using the "Defaults for all windows" in the "Window Specification" section

Basically using this can have 2 major scenarios:
1. Leave it on by default, but disable it for the few specific
   applications that do not behave well with it. (default)
2. Leave it off by default, and enable it for all applications for
   which you want it enabled.

At this point all applications we tested work ok, some of them even
work better with this feature turned on: for example xmms and Corel's
WorkPerfect8 now only have 1 appicon (they used to have 2 without this
feature).

This feature is turned off by default for the following applications
because it's incompatible with them:
1. all GNUstep applications
2. applications with an application menu (wterm, Aileron, etc)
3. all applications with withdrawn windows only (this means all dockapps)

As a side note: wterm can use the shared appicon feature as long as it
doesn't use the appmenu (will do this by default). If you start it
using the appmenu (wterm -wm) it will disable the shared appicon
feature because apps with appmenus are incompatible with this feature.

If an application is a GNUstep application or if it has an appmenu, it's
detected automatically and the shared appicon is disabled automatically
without any user intervention or need to configure anything.


Dock/Clip stealing appicons
---------------------------

This feature is different form the Clip's "Autoattract Icons" feature
as it won't attach any new icon to the dock/clip.
What it does, is when you start an application by other means than
dock/clip, like for example using the main menu or a terminal, it will
search the dock/clips for the presence of an appicon for that
application, that is not already running at that moment and will attach
the started application to that appicon in the dock/clip if available,
making it look like the dock/clip just stole the appicon for the started
application. There is an animation for this to offer visual feedback
that this happened.



--- 0.70.0

New dock option
---------------

Copy/paste launch in dock.
==========================

For example, put netscape %s in the Docked icon for Netscape, select an url
somewhere and then middle-click the icon. The command will be launched with
the "pasted" string.


Xinerama Support
================

Supported Xinerama features:

- Normal maximization of windows will maximize to only one of the screens,
the one where the cursor pointer is.

- Full Maximize command in window menu

- Place dialogs in the middle of the head where the pointer is

- Try to place windows inside one head in non-manual placement modes


Less dependencies
-----------------

starting with 0.70.0 libPropList is no longer required to build Window
Maker. PropList handling code was added to WINGs being now better
integrated with all the rest. For more details check the Changelog and the 
following files:
./WINGs/ChangeLog
./WINGs/NEWS
./WINGs/WINGs/WUtil.h
./WINGs/WINGs/proplist-compat.h



--- 0.65.1

Removed FocusFollowMouse option, only SloppyFocus present now.

Added None option to MoveDisplay and ResizeDisplay



--- 0.65.0

Single AppIcon
--------------

Removed --single-appicon patch and replaced it with a application
specific collapsing option. Check inspector panel and appicon menu.

New options to configure the workspace mouse actions
----------------------------------------------------

The following options were removed from the WindowMaker defaults configuration
file:

SelectWindowsMouseButton, WindowListMouseButton and ApplicationMenuMouseButton.

They were replaced with the following 3+1:

MouseLeftButtonAction, MouseMiddleButtonAction and MouseRightButtonAction plus
MouseWheelAction

In the old way because all gravitated around the workspace actions to which
specific mouse buttons could have been bound, it allowed one to specify in
the configuration file settings which would have led to weird situations
that also had undesirable results.
For example the same mouse button (for example left) could have been
assigned to all workspace actions: 'select windows', 'show window list menu'
and 'show applications menu' which of course were not only impossible to
accomplish while still having a properly working workspace, but they also
allowed one to specify some settings in the configuration file that were
never in fact translatable to proper workspace actions.

To void this kind of user interface inconsistency, the new options now
gravitate around the physical device (the mouse and its buttons) to which
specific workspace actions can be bound. This way, even if one assigns the
same action to all mouse buttons, that situation while gives redundant and
unpractical settings it will still translatable to proper workspace actions:
all buttons will execute the same action, but a button will execute only one
action at a time.

The new options take the following values:
all Mouse...ButtonAction can have one of the following values:

None, SelectWindows, OpenApplicationsMenu or OpenWindowListMenu

MouseWheelAction can be one of None or SwitchWorkspaces

If you had the default actions bound to mouse buttons before, then it will
work for you without any intervention in the configuration files.
Else you need to use WPrefs.app to bind the actions to the mouse buttons
again to your old settings. Also if you want to change the mouse wheel
behavior regarding workspaces you can now (use WPrefs.app to do this).

Client supplied icons
---------------------

Window Maker saves the client supplied icons in 
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/CachedPixmaps in XPM format for later use 
when the app is no longer running (to have the image to display for docked 
icons for example).

Until recently the XPM images saved by Window Maker were incorrect, but a
recent fix in the code to save XPM's fixed them. But with this fix, all
previously saved XPM's in that directory are no longer readable (they give
wrong images on screen or fail to load).

To avoid the need for the user to fix this by hand editing WMWindowAttributes 
and removing all references to icons in ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/CachedPixmaps 
which can be annoying, new code was added to Window Maker to permit the 
regeneration of images in ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/CachedPixmaps if they are missing.

With this addition, all you need to do to fix your old broken images, is to
delete all *.xpm files from ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/CachedPixmaps. Next time the
application that is supplying an icon image will start the icon will be
recreated if missing, but this time it will be saved with the new XPM save
code which produces good XPM images.
All the rest of the process is transparent to the user.

Hermes library support
----------------------

If configure finds hermes library (an optimized pixel format conversion
library) installed it will use it to do the pixel format conversion in
the wraster library for some cases (TrueColor visuals without dithering).
Currently the hermes routines cannot convert to an indexed destination,
so we can't use hermes for PseudoColor, GrayScale and StaticGray visuals.
Also hermes only does dithering for just 2 combinations of source/destination
bits/masks none of them useful to out needs so for dithering we still
use out routines.

The Hermes library is completely optional, you can build Window Maker
without having it, it just speeds up the things a little for some
situations.

hermes library is available here: http://www.clanlib.org/hermes/


--- 0.64.0

No Polling of Configuration Files
---------------------------------

Running Window Maker with one of -nopolling or --no-polling command line
options will make it not to poll every 3 seconds for changes in its
configuration files (good for laptops to let them spin disks down when idle).

Note:
For the ones used with Jim Knoble's 'no polling' patch, this is the same,
except that the need to #define ENABLE_NO_POLLING in wconfig.h was removed
and the behavior is always available if you use the command line option.


--- 0.63.0


Interwoven Gradient
-------------------

interwoven gradients rip^Winspired on blackbox. Will render a texture that
interweaves 2 different ones.

(igradient, from1, to1, thickness1, from2, to2, thickness2)

Will render a interwoven texture with the 2 specified gradients,
with each section having the specified thickness.

wmagnify
--------

The wmagnify utility will magnify the area on the screen where
your mouse pointer is located, updating it in real-time.

tip: maximize it horizontally, make it Omnipresent and Always at Bottom.
Then leave it in the bottom of the screen.

workspace border
----------------

2 options (WorkspaceBorder and WorkspaceBorderSize) were added to allow one to
set a small (0..5 pixels) border for the workspace. This border will not be
covered by windows when maximizing, allowing one to easily access the clip
or map a menu using the mouse in the border area, even when there are
windows maximized in both horizontal and vertical directions.
WorkspaceBorder can be one of (None, LeftRight, TopBottom, AllDirections)
while WorkspaceBorderSize is the size in pixels of the border not to be
covered by windows when maximizing (usually a small amount 0..5 pixels).

Both options can be set using WPrefs.app in the "Miscellaneous Ergonomic
Preferences" section. WPrefs will always limit WorkspaceBorderSize in the
(0..5) range.

Note that if "full screen maximization" option is set for a window, that
window will ignore this border area, maximizing to full screen.


--- 0.62.0


Optimizations!!
---------------

Code for converting wrlib images into X Pixmaps was optimized in many ways,
both in the original C code and in assembly for Pentium(tm) processors (with
and without MMX(tm)). Depending on the bit depth/color mode and CPU model,
performance increases can go up to 150%


Weendoze Window Cycling (alt-tab)
---------------------------------

Window cycling was changed to weendoze style. 


NoBorder Window Attribute
--------------------------

The NoBorder window attribute (to be put in
~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowAttributes) was added and will remove the
1 pixel border around windows.


Removed "Keep Attracted Icons" option from Clip's menu
------------------------------------------------------

Since this option brought more confusion than usefulness among users, and
since it was usable only in a very limited context, being able to fill up
the Clip very easily, it was removed.
An alternative way of gaining the same functionality is to use the "Keep icon"
entry in the Clip's main menu. Or select multiple icons before calling that
entry, to make it apply to more than one icon.

Note: "Keep icon", as the obsoleted "Keep Attracted Icons" had nothing to do
      with holding icons in Clip, while the application is running. Once they
      are attracted, they are kept until the application close. Using
      "Keep icon", will only assure that the icon will be kept, even after the
      application is closed.

Please don't ask for this option back. It's error prone, and very unintuitive.
Considering it's very restrictive usability, and it's very ambiguous topic, it
does not need a special entry in the Clip's menu, taking in count that there
are already better alternative ways of gaining the same functionality.


Removed DisplayFont Option
---------------------------

The font for the geometry size will be controlled by the default
WINGs font (SystemFont in WMGLOBAL) now.


Others
------

- added DONT_SCALE_ICONS compile time option
- added --dont-restore cmd line option. When passed to wmaker, it
  wont restore the state saved previously.

--- 0.61.1

New libPropList
---------------

new libPropList-0.9.1 is REQUIRED to build Window Maker 0.61.1.
go grab it and install it first.


--- 0.60.1


Window Edge Attraction
----------------------

Window edge attraction was now added.

Attraction = YES/NO;

will enable/disable gravity to edge's border.
The strength of gravity can be controlled by modify `EdgeResistance' value
in WindowMaker configuration file.


Titlebar Draw String Plugin
---------------------------

FTitleColor, UTitleColor, PTitleColor, MenuTitleColor can be assigned with
drawstring plugin instead of plain color. For example:

    FTitleColor = (
        function,
        libwmfun.so,
        drawPlainString,
        gold,
        black,
        gray49
    );

will invoke function drawplainstring from libwmfun.so and pass 3 colors for
arguments. To code new plugin, please see plugin.h for more information.


--- 0.60.0


User Menu
---------

The user menu is now a compile time option disabled by default. 
Supply --enable-usermenu to configure to enable it.


root menu INCOMPATIBLE changes
------------------------------

EXEC <program> will execute the named program

SHEXEC <command> will execute the shell command.

If you want to execute something like blabla > /dev/null, then use SHEXEC

Don't forget to update your menus.


New Option For setstyle
-----------------------

The --ignore flag will tell setstyle to not change the option that is
specified, when modifying the Window Maker configurations. For example:

setstyle --ignore MenuStyle sometheme.themed will cause the MenuStyle
option to not be changed.

setstyle --ignore FTitleBack --ignore UTitleBack --ignore PTitleBack bla.themed
will load the theme, but keep the titlebar background related options as
before.


MultiByte Text Support Changes
------------------------------

The --enable-kanji configure option is not needed anymore and was removed.
To enable support for multibyte text, you must:
- set the LANG environment variable to the appropriate value
- change the font configurations to contain font sets in the appropriate
  encodings in both ~/G/D/WindowMaker and ~/G/D/WMGLOBAL (for WPrefs)
- set the MultiByteText option to YES in both of the above files


New Options
-----------

WorkspaceNameDisplayPosition =
none/center/top/bottom/topleft/topright/bottomleft/bottomright


SmoothWorkspaceBack = YES/NO

will enable smoothing of scaled workspace background images.



Application User Menu Path Changes
----------------------------------

Default configuration for user specific menus installed in
/usr/local/share/WindowMaker/UserMenus or $(datadir)/WindowMaker/UserMenus
and ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/UserMenus.


Omnipresent icons in Clip
-------------------------

Added ability to set icons docked in Clip to be omnipresent on all workspaces.
To set/reset this flag use the clip menu.
The Clip menu changed in the following way:
 - if you bring up the menu from the Clip's main icon, it will contain as
   before the "Rename Workspace" entry in the second position.
 - however, if you bring up the menu from any other icon in clip, the
   "Rename Workspace" menu entry is replaced by "Omnipresent" or
   "Toggle Omnipresent" depending on the context.

This entry will work in the following way, depending on the context:

1. If there is no icon selected in the clip, then the menu will contain the
   entry named "Omnipresent" which will be checked accordingly to the current
   state of the icon (omnipresent or not), and will let you change the
   omnipresent state of the icon you brought the menu from.
2. If one or more icons are already selected when the Clip menu is called, the
   entry will be named "Toggle Omnipresent" and will apply to all selected
   icons trying to toggle their omnipresent state. The icons which will be
   successfully changed to their new state as requested, will be unselected,
   while the ones that will fail for some reason to gain their new state,
   will remain selected.

In both cases if there is no success in setting what user requested a panel
will inform user of the failure.
(Note: trying to set an icon to not-omnipresent will never fail. Failures can
       be met only when trying to set omnipresent for an icon).

The icons set to omnipresent will be marked with a triangle in the upper left
corner, having the color of the IconTitleColor.

An icon can be set to omnipresent, only if its position is free in all the
workspaces, else you will be informed of the problem and asked to fix it first.
Also when dragging an omnipresent icon around in Clip, all the icons docked in
all the workspaces are shown while the dragging is done, to let one easily see
where are free slots in all workspaces.

For advanced users, there is also a shortcut to set/reset the omnipresent
state of an icon: just use "Shift+MiddleButton" (button2) on the icon you want
to change.
In this case only the mark in the upper left corner will appear in case of
success, or nothing will happen if icon cannot be made omnipresent (advanced
users are expected to know why the icon failed to be made omnipresent, so they
don't need a panel to explain them why ;) ).

Now before you load your gun to start a flame war because this is against your
principles you love so much, please sit down and think that this is a feature,
which, if you don't use, the old behavior of the Clip is totally preserved.
It just adds some extra capabilities to the Clip for people who think that this
is useful.


XDND drop on dock support
-------------------------

Support for XDE on dock is now replaced by XDND.
To enable, edit src/wconfig.h



--- 0.53.0

New Options
-----------

** MenuStyle

MenuStyle=<style>; will change the menu texture style.

<style> can be:
normal (default): for the traditional one texture per item, with bevels in 
each

singleTexture: for a single texture that spans the whole menu, with bevels
in each item

flat: singleTexture without the bevels


** ResizebarBack

ResizebarBack=<texture>;

where <texture> is any of the textures you normally use in titlebars and
other places.

If the style file/theme does not contain a ResizebarBack option, setstyle
will automatically hack it so that wmaker will make the theme work like 
before.


New crash dialog panel
----------------------

From now on, whenever a fatal situation appears, Window Maker will display a
dialog panel to the user and let him choose what to do.
The options are:
- Abort and leave a core file (useful for debugging and getting backtraces)
- Restart Window Maker (default behavior)
- Start alternate window manager (the one defined as fallback, or if not
  possible fvwm or twm in this order).

If it will not be able to restart or start the alternate window manager, it
will abort and leave the core file.


Application User Menu
---------------------

Applications with an appicon can have a user defined menu.

This menu will emulate keyboard events, and will be sent to the applications'
window(s), thus the application must accept key combinations (CTRL+N for
instance).

To enable this feature, #define USER_MENU in src/wconfig.h and place menu
files in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/UserMenus (/usr/local/etc/WindowMaker/UserMenus
globally).

The user menu is in PropList format and the filename is in:
<instance name>.<class name>.menu or application's main window.
(Example: the menu for xcalc would be - xcalc.XCalc.menu)

Example user menu syntax:

(
  "Calculator",
  ("Put 1", SHORTCUT, "2"),
  ("Functions",
    ("Put 2", SHORTCUT, "2"),
    ("Put 3,4 and 5", SHORTCUT, (3,4,5))
  ),
  ("Exit", SHORTCUT, "Control+q")
)



--- 0.52.0


Appearance Editing in WPrefs
----------------------------

Added Appearance/Texture editing capability in WPrefs. Workspace background
selection is not yet finished.


Themes
------

Removed all themes from the source tree, and moved them in a separate package.
You can download the new package from the same place as this package:
ftp://ftp.windowmaker.info/pub/beta/srcs/
Look after WindowMaker-extra-<version-number>.tar.gz
Also WindowMaker-extra pack include the old WindowMaker-data.tar.gz which only
contained icons.
Look for the greatest version number when you download this package.


get-wraster-flags script change
-------------------------------

The name of the options passed to get-wraster-flags changed, to allow a better
name compatibility with the naming conventions used by other software.
The name change was as follows:
--lflags was changed in --ldflags
To allow backward compatibility, with already written software, the old
--lflags option is still recognized, but you are encouraged to move the the
new --ldflags.



--- 0.51.2


New Themes
----------

Added 2 new cool themes (actually I added in 0.51.1, but forgot
to put it here...) from largo (LeetWM) and BadlandZ (STEP2000).


Full Screen Maximization
------------------------

The FullMaximize window attribute will allow the window to
be maximized to the full size of the screen (ignoring anything
like titlebar, resizebar, dock, panels etc). It should be useful
for programs that must use the whole screen, like games or things 
like presentation programs.


--- 0.51.1

KDE Application Menu script
---------------------------

wkdemenu.pl is a converter from KDE application menu structures to wmaker 
menu that can be used as a piped menu. Look wkdemenu.sh for how to use it.


Window Edge Resistance
----------------------

Window edge resistance was now added. No, feature freeze hasn't been
removed. Its just part of the edge resistance rewrite ;)


New Theme
---------

Added SteelBlueSilk theme

Installation Path Changes
-------------------------

Default configuration data installed in /usr/local/etc/WindowMaker
or $(sysconfdir)/WindowMaker


--- 0.51.0

Window Maker has become a GNU program (part of the GNU Project).

Title text drop shadow
----------------------

drop shadow option added for titlebar text. This is a compile time 
option which needs to be defined in src/wconfig.h after you run
configure and before you run make.

New options and syntax for your WindowMaker domain file are:

  Shadow = yes/no;
  FShadowColor = <color>;  
  PShadowColor = <color>;
  UShadowColor = <color>;
  MShadowColor = <color>;

The shadow option is dynamic (no need for a restart).
MShadowColor is for the menu title text.

libPropList
-----------

WARNING!!! libPropList was removed from the Window Maker distribution
and is being distributed separately. If you don't have it installed yet,
get it from ftp.windowmaker.info/pub/libs and install before building
Window Maker.


signal handling change
----------------------
SIGHUP will exit wmaker instead of restarting it!!! This is because
GNOME expects the window manager to exit instead of restarting...
Complaints should go to gnome people. SIGUSR1 will restart wmaker now.


script change
-------------
WINGs-flags was removed, and replaced by get-wraster-flags.
Please remove WINGs-flags from your system, since it was obsoleted by
get-wraster-flags.
Continuing to use WINGs-flags can lead to hazardous effects, since is no
longer updated.


docklib
-------

docklib is a little library for making dock applets. It's in the
docklib-0.0.tar.gz file. Unpack it and read the README file there.


Option Changes
--------------

Removed OnTopTransients option

Added OpenTransientOnOwnerWorkspace


Olwm Hint Support
-----------------

OPEN LOOK(tm)/olwm hints support was added.

Read the appropriate section in the README file.



--- 0.50.1

New option for WorkspaceBack. mpixmap is the same as spixmap, but
it will scale the pixmap by keeping the aspect ratio (maximize or maxpect).
The option only works for workspace backgrounds.

Also added IGNORE_PPOSITION compile time flag, which is equivalent
to NoPPosition from fvwm. 




--- 0.50.0


KDE and GNOME
-------------

Added full support for GNOME and KWM hints. 
Read the INSTALL file to see how enable them.

Everything in the so called GNOME window manager bla bla bla pseudo-spec is
implemented.

As for KDE stuff, it implements 90% of everything kwm does, adds some
Window Maker specific extensions to it and still uses half of the memory
kwm does, which should be enough to let you dump kwm ;) For details on what
exactly is implemented, see comments in src/kwm.c Read the README.KDE file 
for more information.


WARNING: Some KDE hints are badly designed, so doing things like using
kpanel's desktop switcher/pager and Window Maker's internal workspace
management functions to create, destroy and rename workspaces at the same 
time might cause unknown effects. To be on the safe side, only
use either of them to manage workspaces. Switching workspaces is hopefully,
safe, so you can switch workspaces from wherever you want.



Workspace Specific Background Images
------------------------------------

Use the WorkspaceSpecificBack to set background images for specific
workspaces. The WorkspaceBack is used as the default background image.

Example:

WorkspaceSpecificBack = ((solid, red), (cpixmap, ship.jpg, gray), (), 
				(dgradient, red, blue))

This will set the background image of workspace 1 to (solid, 0),
2 to ship.jpg and 4 to a gradient. Workspace 3 and other workspaces
will have the image defined by WorkspaceBack.

Note that this uses quite some memory...


setstyle/getstyle
-----------------

setstyle now accepts the -nofonts flag, which will load the style
file ignoring all font related options.

Example:

setstyle -nofonts Blabla.style


getstyle can be used to create theme packs. See the usage in the
WindowMaker/README.themes file.



New Texture Type
----------------

Textured gradients will tile a texture pixmap and combine it with a gradient, 
using an arbitrary opaqueness. 

Syntax is (thgradient, <file>, <opaqueness>, <color1>, <color2>)
	  (tvgradient, <file>, <opaqueness>, <color1>, <color2>)
	  (tdgradient, <file>, <opaqueness>, <color1>, <color2>)
where:
<color1> and <color2> are the colors for the gradient,
<file> is the texture file and
<opaqueness> is the opaqueness to merge the texture with the gradient,
ranging from 0 to 255.

Example:

(thgradient, "BlueImage.jpeg", 120, white, black)

The BlackTexture style and Checker theme are examples.

Hints:

You can use any type of pixmap file for this, but small (like 64x32)
grayscale pixmap files should get the best results (fast and low memory
usage). You can use color pixmaps, but it is harder to get the desired effect
with them.

Be warned that this texture type is the slowest.



New Options
-----------

IconTitleBack and IconTitleColor control the color of the
miniwindow title. Both of them are colors.

Example:
IconTitleColor=white;
IconTitleBack=black;


Since this introduces an incompatibility in themes and getting flamed by the
themes ppl isn't the most pleasant thing ("Whaddafuk you're thinking!? You
just broke 500 themes!!!" ;) the setstyle command was hacked so that it will
make old themes work as before, by trying to automatically set the above
options. Note that in some cases it will not have exactly the same results as
before.


StartMaximized window attribute. Will maximize the window when it
is mapped.


AutoRaiseLower option for the Clip. This allows automatic Raise/Lower of the
Clip icons when the mouse pointer enter/leave the Clip. To avoid unwanted
raising/lowering there is a time threshold before raising/lowering.
The thresholds can be changed in wconfig.h by changing one or both of
AUTO_LOWER_DELAY and AUTO_RAISE_DELAY (expressed in milliseconds).
For example if you set AUTO_RAISE_DELAY to 0, then the Clip will be raised as
soon as the mouse pointer enters it's area. Setting AUTO_RAISE_DELAY to a very
big value, will make the Clip to practically do not auto raise unless clicked,
but to be automatically lowered after AUTO_LOWER_DELAY (ms) when leaved.


New ThemePack Format
--------------------

Starting with this version, a new format of themes is being supported.
Before you open pine and start composing your flame, rest assured that
the old format is still supported. The new format is documented
in the WindowMaker/README.themes file.


Root Menu 
---------

The -noext option for OPEN_MENU will strip whatever is after the last .
in file names that appear on the opened directory. So,

OPEN_MENU ~/bg WITH xv -root -quit

will create a menu with all the images in ~/bg without the extension.



--- 0.20.3


Icon (miniwindow) stacking
--------------------------

If you want miniwindows to reside under normal windows, edit
wconfig.h and change WNormalLevel (just grep for it) to
WDesktopLevel


5 Button Mouse
--------------

If you have a 5 button mouse and want to give some utility for
the extra 2 buttons, edit the appropriate line in src/wconfig.h
Clicking Button4 in the root window will switch you to the previous 
workspace and Button5 will do that for the next.


Option Changes
--------------

put NoWindowOverDock back

KeepOnBottom window attribute


-static command line option
---------------------------

wmaker -static will start Window Maker in static mode. This will
prevent wmaker from checking or making any configuration changes.
That makes it possible to run wmaker before running wmaker.inst


Hysteresis for menu item selection
----------------------------------

Hopefully it's intelligent enough, so you won't notice it.

In case you want to know what's it, it's equivalent to that
(insanely long) 2 second delay present in that Windoze95 menu, 
but more useful than annoying (I hope :). To see it, do the following
with your current wmaker version and later with 0.20.3:

- open the apps menu and stick it
- click in the item for the "Workspaces" submenu and hold
- drag the mouse to the 4th or bigger entry (like "Workspace 4") in a
straight line, trying to select the target item before the submenu
is unmapped when you dragged over other items in the main menu



Window Shortcuts
----------------

Window shortcuts are shortcuts to arbitrary windows. You can make up to 4
shortcuts. To assign a previously bound shortcut to a window use the "Select
Shortcut" submenu in the window commands menu. If the shortcut is not yet
assigned for any window, you can hit the shortcut to assign it to the active
window. The shortcut will do the same as clicking in an entry in the window
list menu. The keys for the shortcuts are defined in the ~/G/D/WindowMaker
file or in WPrefs.app

Option names are:

WindowShortcut1Key through WindowShortcut4Key


--- 0.20.2


The name of WindowMaker was changed to Window Maker.

Window creation animation disabled by default.

xdaliclock -shape
-----------------

If you use it edit src/wconfig.h and #define OPTIMIZE_SHAPE or disable the
titlebar and resizebar for the window. OPTIMIZE_SHAPE will remove the
flickering for xdaliclock and other programs that change their shapes often,
but will increase network traffic considerably. So, if you use xdaliclock
from a remote machine it can get slow.


Applications Menu
-----------------

The applications menu will now use the shell in the SHELL environment
variable to execute EXEC menu commands. If it is unset (I think it's always
automatically set by the shell program) it will use /bin/sh


Extra fancy icon kaboom :)
--------------------------

Edit src/wconfig.h and #define ICON_KABOOM_EXTRA to get
more effects for the icon undocking animation.

Options for superfluous stuff are even more superfluous, so this
will not become run-time.


XDE drag and drop support
-------------------------

Support for XDE drag and drop was added (by "]d" <id@maliwan.org>).
To enable, edit src/wconfig.h
The support works with gtk 1.1.2


libPropList
-----------

libPropList will now be built automatically by wmaker. Which means
the (simplified) building process is now:

./configure
make
make install

instead of:

tar xzf libPropList.tar.gz
(cd libPropList; make)
make
make install

You also don't need to worry about GNOME libPropList incompatibilities
anymore. 


Bug with focus lost in sloppy focus fixed
-----------------------------------------

The bug only occurs in sloppy or auto focus modes, with AutoFocus disabled
and Superfluous enabled. There is no easy/clean way to fix this, so Window
Maker will disable the animation of window creation if the focus mode is
either sloppy or auto AND AutoFocus=NO.

If you want the animation, enable AutoFocus or use manual focus mode
(preferred).


The NoWindowUnderDock option was removed
----------------------------------------
To obtain the same result, use the "Keep Dock On Top" option in the dock menu.


Persistent Program Supplied Icons
---------------------------------

Application supplied icons are now stored, so that the dock will keep
showing them after the app is exited. The icons are stored at
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/CachedPixmaps


Sound support
-------------

Sound support is now on by default. Even if you don't use sound the overhead
is very small, and has no impact on performance. If you still want to
optimize it and remove a few hundred of bytes, then use --disable-sound or
--enable-sound=no options when you configure Window Maker.


--- 0.20.0

  
Multihead support. wmaker will now manage all screens that are attached to the
display. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  

It does so from a single process (instead of spawning a new process for each
screen, like fvwm does). This keeps memory usage a lot lower than fvwm.

State files have a suffix .n, where n is the number of the screen.

Since I don't have a real multiheaded machine, it probably has bugs.

Superfluous
-----------

Yet another useless superfluous animation. Find out what exactly it is
by yourself :)


exitscript
----------

~/G/L/W/exitscript will be called automatically when wmaker is exited.


New runtime options
-------------------

1. Miniaturization animation is now selectable by a run-time option
Add a line with

IconificationStyle = <style>;

to your WindowMaker configuration file.
<style> can be one of: Zoom, Twist, Flip or None
Case doesn't matter, and default is Zoom.


2. Edge resistance.
This can be controlled by setting:

EdgeResistance = xxx;

in your WindowMaker configuration file.
xxx is an integer greater than 0 and represents the number of pixels of edge
resistance. Setting it to 0 (default) will disable this feature.

New theme
---------

A new theme named Night, is available in this distribution.



--- 0.19.3

GIF support was added. You will need libgif 2.2 to use it.

cpixmap added. Syntax is the same as tpixmap or spixmap


--- 0.19.2

getstyle will include IconBack info in Style files.

--- 0.19.0

libPropList was updated. If you have it installed, you must upgrade or
WPrefs will crash because of bugs in libPropList.

New options
-----------

Balloons!
---------

WindowTitleBalloons = YES;
will enable balloons for window titles that are not fully visible.

MiniwindowTitleBalloons = YES;
will enable balloons for miniwindow titles.

AppIconBalloons = YES;
for application icons (docked or not)


IconPosition
------------

IconPosition (the position of the icons) is specified as:

IconPosition = c1c2c3;

where:

c1 can be t or b (meaning top or bottom)
c2 can be l or r (meaning left or right)
c3 can be v or h (meaning vertical or horizontal)

case is insensitive.

For example, 
IconPosition = blh;

is the old iconPosition position.

IconPosition = trv;

will place the icons over the Dock.

New window attribute
--------------------

EmulateAppIcon = YES; will make the window have an application icon.
Only use this option for fully specified windows (like rxvt.Rxvt).
NEVER use in generic window specifications (like * or rxvt).
You must restart the application for the attribute to take effect.


WPrefs.app
----------

Read WPrefs/README


--- 0.18.1

Boolean values have changed!!! YES, Y and any non-zero integer will
mean TRUE and anything else (including True) will mean FALSE. This
is to conform to the OpenStep values used for booleans and
not cause headaches later, when GNUstep apps also starts using
defaults and users will try using True which won't get recognized.


--- 0.18.0

Clip
----

Clip button layout was changed. IT IS TEMPORARY AND THE DEFINITIVE LOOK
WILL BE DIFFERENT!!!


libPropList
-----------

More bugs were fixed in it. Upgrade the library if you have an older version
installed, with the one included.


Property list menus
-------------------

Format for property list menus has changed! The redundant array for
submenus was removed, so a menu that looked like:

( Applications,
  ("Xterm", EXEC, "xterm"),
  ( 
    (Paint,
  	("Gimp", EXEC, "gimp"),
	("XV", EXEC, "xv")
    )
  )
)

must be changed to:

( Applications,
  ("Xterm", EXEC, "xterm"),
  (Paint,
  	("Gimp", EXEC, "gimp"),
	("XV", EXEC, "xv")
  )
)



Misc
----

NUMLOCK_HACK is back. This time it works and is enabled by default.
If you think you don't need it and promise me that you won't send 
"bug" reports saying that shortcuts stop working after a while, you can
disable it ;) It will save some memory and CPU.


Configuration
-------------

Removed the SwapMenuButton option and added 3 finer grained options:

SelectWindowsMouseButton
WindowListMouseButton
ApplicationMenuMouseButton

Values that can be used are Left, Middle, Right and Button1 through Button5
Left is equivalent to Button1, Middle to Button2 and Right to Button3


Removed the WorkspaceChangeDelay option and corresponding action.
Removed AClipColor and IClipColor


Added the SelectKey back


Changed default binding of Window commands menu from F10 to Control+Escape

--- 0.17.4

Misc
-----

libPropList has changed! Upgrade it before compiling wmaker.

Hopefully the bugs that caused wmaker to crash if an error is found
in the config files is fixed. If you do crash wmaker with a bad
file, please try to find out the smallest possible portion of the file
that still crashes wmaker and send it to me.


New Options
-----------

PixmapPath was split to PixmapPath and IconPath. PixmapPath is the path
for the pixmaps used as textures and IconPath is for the icons. 
Don't forget to add IconPath to your current configuration file.

There's also a new library in ~/GNUstep/Library/Icons. You should place
your icons there, since icons are not a WindowMaker specific resource.


DontConfirmKill=YES; will disable the confirmation panel for Kill


--- 0.17.3

Interface Changes
-----------------

Unhide Here in the appicon menu was changed to be the first entry.
This way you can unhide the appicon with a single click without
even moving the pointer.


Clip Commands
-------------

The collect icons commands was renamed to attract icons and
the attract icons options was renamed to Auto attract icons.

The Remove Selected Icons was renamed to Remove Icon(s). It will
act as before if some icon is selected and will remove the clicked
icon (without confirmation) if it is not.

Added a Keep Icon(s) command that will keep the selected icons if
any is selected and the current one if none.

The Move To command was renamed to Move Icon(s) To.


--- 0.17.0

If you have libPropList installed, you might want to re-install it,
replacing with the included libPropList. It has a small bug fix.

Misc. Changes
-------------

Removed --with-gnome and made MWM_HINTS defined by default.
This means that "GNOME support" will work with no additional
flags passed to configure. 

Added support for KDE, by adding a DisableWorkspaceMouseActions option.
Set it to YES and run krootwm to be able to use everything in kfm.


Shortcuts for Root Menu
-----------------------

There is now a new SHORTCUT optional keyword for the menus.
For example, you can bind Control-F1 to xterm with:

"XTerm" SHORTCUT Control+F1 EXEC xterm

or F2 to ARRANGE_ICONS with:

"Arrange Icons" SHORTCUT F2 ARRANGE_ICONS


All commands allowed in the menu file accept the keyword, except for
MENU and OPEN_MENU


Interface Changes
-----------------

** Configuration of docked applications is now done in a panel instead of
in the menu. 

** Added a command menu for application icons

** Shift double-click on the application icon will unhide the app
in the current workspace.


Option Changes
--------------

NotMiniaturizable option changed to NoMiniaturizeButton
NotClosable option changed to NoCloseButton


Speed options values are now UltraFast, Fast, Medium, Slow or UltraSlow
				              ^^^^^^

Removed the Select keyboard binding. You can access it in the window
commands menu.

Removed the ClipMaxIcons option and made it a compile time option.

Removed the ConstrainWindowSize option

Renamed NoSound to DisableSound

Renamed NoAutowrap to DontLinkWorkspaces

Renamed NoDithering to DisableDithering

Renamed NoAnimations to DisableAnimations

Removed the LeftHanded option and added a SwapMenuButton option.
SwapMenuButton will make the rubberband selection in the root window
be bound to the right button and the root menu to the left button.


New way to display temporary icons
----------------------------------

The icons that are attracted by Clip, but will not be kept after the
application close, are now using a different color for shading, unlike previous
version that always used white. This will improve look for very different color
combinations, and allow the user to control the look of the shaded icon.
The color used for shading the icons is computed as follows:

First a color is computed depending on the IconBack type:
 - for solid the color is the solid color itself.
 - for simple gradients the color is (from_color + to_color)/2.
 - for multiple gradients, the color is the first color in list.
 - for pixmaps, the color is the solid color specified for that pixmap.

Then the color is made lighter by multiplying each red/green/blue filed with
1.7 and limiting each field to 0xff in case they exceed this value.
Then this new color will be used by superposing it with the icon we want to
shade, using a proper alpha value.

To control the color for shading is simple:

- In case of multi gradients you just need to put the first color, as the color
you like. WindowMaker do not use the first color in the list to directly build
the gradient, but only when it needs a solid color for something (like in this
case).

- For pixmaps, put the needed color as the solid color the syntax for pixmaps
require. This color is also not used when displaying normal icons, just when
solid colors are needed (like this case).

- For solid color, or simple gradients, in case the color it uses after
computing is not good enough, you can always convert the solid or simple
gradient to a multi gradient with the same look, and use that one. In this
case is simple, just put the needed color as first color in list.

Please note that this will not slow down WindowMaker, because the IconBack is
read only once at startup, and then only if it is changed. After reading it WM
will construct the image of the tile, and use the image instead of recomputing
the gradient every time.

Here are 2 examples of converting solid or simple gradient to a same looking
multi gradient:

IconBack = (solid, Blue);
will become
IconBack = (mhgradient , LightBlue, Blue, Blue);
using LightBlue as color for shading.

IconBack = (dgradient, "#284569", "#082420");
will become
IconBack = (mdgradient, "#183454", "#284569", "#082420");
looking the same, but using #183454 for shading.


New Sound Server Location
-------------------------

The sound server new URL is http://www.frontiernet.net/~southgat/wmsound
Also it seems to be running on FreeBSD too (with little changes maybe).


--- 0.16.1

WINGs
-----

The path for the WINGs resource files was changed. If you don't
do make install, you must move /usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Resources to
/usr/local/share/WINGs


New Options
-----------

The following new options are available:
NewStyle = Yes/No; (static) Replaces --enable-newstyle
DisableDock = Yes/No; (static) Same as -nodock command line option.
DisableClip = Yes/No; (static) Same as -noclip.
Superfluous = Yes/No; (dynamic) Replaces --enable-superfluous.

NOTES.
- The static options are only read at startup. Changing them, needs to restart,
  so they will be accounted.
- DisableDock and DisableClip have lower precedence than -nodock -noclip
  command line options. If both option/command line option are given, then the
  command line option will be accounted.


Start Hidden option
-------------------

The start hidden option was fixed, and made to be an application wide option.
It will apply to every window the application owns. Also its place in the
Attribute Inspector panel, changed accordingly, to reflect this.
The start miniaturized is however still applying to particular windows of an
application, unless the option is set for the class.
Start miniaturized, will override start hidden if both set.

IMPORTANT NOTE.
Because of the way Netscape Communicator is implemented, it is NOT possible
to set the start hidden or miniaturized flags for it. This is because Netscape
chooses to send a second map event to the window it maps. This makes the
window to receive a second map request and to be unhidden or maximized back,
immediately after it was hidden or miniaturized by WindowMaker at startup.



--- 0.16.0

Misc. Changes
-------------

The NextMenuBehaviour option was renamed to WrapMenus
The WorkspaceTiedMiniwindows option was renamed to StickyIcons

The .tif files were renamed to .tiff


Selecting Mini Windows
----------------------

Now miniaturized windows can be selected as well as normal windows.
You can do this by Shift-Click-ing them. They will be marked, and will follow
you through workspaces like normal selected windows do.
Miniaturizing a window will no longer deselect the window, but will place the
icon and mark it as selected.
The only difference between miniaturized and normal window selection is that
for the moment the rubber-band selecting method works only for normal windows.


Icon Selection Panel in Attributes Editor
-----------------------------------------

Now, selecting icons is as easy as clicking in the file name in a list.


Simplified Options
------------------

IconSlideStep, IconSlideSlowDown and IconSlideDelay were merged to 
IconSlideSpeed

MenuScrollStep and MenuScrollDelay were merged to MenuScrollSpeed

ShadeStep and ShadeDelay were merged to ShadeSpeed


Valid values for them are: Fast, Normal, Slow or UltraSlow

If you want to fine tune the values, they can be changed in wconfig.h
Send me your set of values with an indication of how fast is your hardware,
so that I can make the default values more adequate.


New Window Attributes
---------------------

Added StartMiniaturized and StartHidden as window attributes and
removed the previous implementation. Also removed the dock menu entries.
They are now settable in the Attributes Panel.

Also added DontSaveSession attribute. This way, you won't end up with multiple
unwanted copies of the same app after the previous session is restored.
I start X with a xterm in .xinitrc instead of wmaker, which will cause the
xterm restored by wmaker be duplicate. Just add -name something to the
xterm started form .xinitrc and mark DontSaveSession=YES for that window.



User Specifiable Visual IDs
---------------------------

wmaker now supports different visuals than the default one. It isn't of much
use for most people, but can be useful for lucky SGI users who want it
to use TrueColor instead of the default PseudoColor.

wmaker -visualid VISUAL_ID

where VISUAL_ID is the hex code for the visual you want.

Note: I don't have an SGI box and haven't tested it...



Starting Workspace
------------------

The starting workspace is identified in the following order:
1. If the app is omnipresent will be mapped on the current workspace.
2. Else if the application have a StartWorkspace option set as attribute
   then this one will be used.
3. Else, if the application was started from Clip, the workspace on which
   the Clip from where it was started is used.
4. Else the current workspace is used.

Restoring saved sessions will always use the saved workspace, no matter
what other options are, except omnipresent.



--- 0.15.1

Workspace specific mini windows
-------------------------------

The minimized windows can be workspace specific, being more consistent with
the rest. This is because minimized window represents just another state of a
window (like normal or shaded), which all are workspace specific.
This (or the old "present anywhere") behavior can be set using an option in
the WindowMaker database: WorkspaceTiedMiniWindows = Yes/No;

New way to animate the blowing icons
------------------------------------

There is now a compile time option that allows one to set how the icons are
animated when detaching from dock/clip in superfluous mode.
By default the classic "Falling pieces" animation is used.
If SPREAD_ICON is #define-ed in wconfig.h, then a "Spread in four directions"
animation is used instead. Take a look at the section where this is described
in src/wconfig.h
By default there is #undef SPREAD_ICON to select "Falling pieces" animation.

Auto Collapse for Clip
----------------------

The clip now supports an option named "Auto Collapse" which can be set from
the clip main menu. When set, clip will stay collapsed, and will show itself
when the mouse moves over it. While the mouse is over it, or over any of the
icons attached to the clip, the clip will stay uncollapsed, letting you to
access the attached icons. This is not true for applications like asclock, or
applets of that kind, because the icon window do not belongs to WindowMaker,
but to the application itself. For such icons you must keep the mouse over the
icon groundplate, else it will collapse back. But usually these type of icons
will not stay in a collapsed clip, since one needs to see what they show.
When the clip is leaved it will collapse back after a delay of 1 second, unless
the mouse is moved back to the clip area. The delay can be set modifying
AUTO_COLLAPSE_DELAY in wconfig.h. Default is 1000 (ms) which means 1 second.




--- 0.15.0

Changed name from Fiend to Clip
-----------------------------------

All occurrences of word Fiend with or without capital F were replaced with
the corresponding Clip (same capital).
This affects all configuration files under ~/GNUstep that contain this word.
It can be referred as "Workspace Dock" too.


New option in Clip menu, and extended Clip behavior
---------------------------------------------------

The following new items are available in the dock menu:

1. Attract Icons
2. Keep Attracted Icons
3. Collect Icons
4. (Un)select All Icons
5. Remove Selected Icons
6. Move To
7. Start miniaturized    (also available for regular dock)
8. Start hidden          (also available for regular dock)
9. Selected
10. Set icon...          (also available for regular dock)


Here is what they do:

1. "Attract Icons" will let the Clip to attract and attach any new appicon that
   is created when an application starts. It will not do this if the Clip is
   full. If the Clip is Collapsed then the appicon will be hidden after it is
   attached.
2. "Keep Attracted Icons" will tell the Clip to keep the attracted appicons,
   after the application is closed. Without this the appicons will vanish,
   leaving the Clip in the original state. If you move an appicon that was
   attracted from Clip to regular Dock, it will be kept when closed, no matter
   what "Keep Attracted Icons" is set to in Clip.
3. "Collect Icons" will collect all appicons that are not yet attached to Dock
   or Clip, and attach them to the current workspace Clip. The value of
   "Keep Attracted Icons" will apply when applications close. If Clip is
   collapsed, the appicons will be hidden.
4. "(Un)select All Icons" will select all icons in the clip if none is
   selected, or it will deselect all selected ones. The selected icons are
   marked using a small triangle in the bottom right corner of the appicon.
   The color of the mark is set using SClipColor in WindowMaker domain
   database.
5. "Remove Selected Icons" will remove from Clip all selected icons. The ones
   that still run, will be detached, all the others will vanish.
6. "Move To" will transfer all selected icons to another workspace and attach
   them to the Clip in that workspace. If none is selected, only the one the
   mouse was pressed on will be moved.
7. "Start miniaturized" will launch (or autolaunch if set) the application in
   a miniaturized state.
8. "Start hidden" will launch (or autolaunch if set) the application in a
   hidden state. Note that only one of the two can be set at a time.
9. "Selected" can be used to toggle the selected state of the appicon
   individually. The same can be achieved using Shift-LeftClick on the appicon.
   In fact the intended way of toggling the selected state is by using
   the Shift-LeftClick on icon. The menu entry is just another way to do the
   same.
10. "Set icon..." will allow one to set the image for the appicon. The image
   will be updated without restart, and also all appicons in the same
   instance.class as the one we set for, will be updated.

So a simple way of avoiding the screen to be filled up with appicons is to set
the "Attract Icons" in the Clip. Also the "Keep Attracted Icons" can be set to
No, so the attracted icons will be deleted when application exits, thus leaving
the Clip clean. If also one to not want to see the appicons that keep filling
the Clip, he can set the Clip to be Collapsed.

Getting rid of unneeded icons in Clip is as simple as selecting them
individually using Shift-LeftClick, and then using the "Remove selected Icons"
entry in menu.


Support for different visuals.
------------------------------

WindowMaker is now able to support any visual, except DirectColor, in any
depth from 1bpp to 32bpp.

One can start the X server with different visuals, by passing the X server the
right option. For XFree 3.3.x is -cc <id>.
WindowMaker is not yet able to choose a different visual from the Default one
on a given screen, but can use any default visual it finds, except the direct
color visual.
For example starting X like (for XFree 3.3.x, and if the driver for the
card supports this. Read the man page for your X server):
startx -- -bpp 8 -cc 0 will give you the StaticGray visual.
startx -- -bpp 8 -cc 1 will give the GrayScale visual
and so on.

Wrlib code is now generic, and will support any visual except DirectColor in
any depth. Programs written with wrlib can work on different visuals from
the default visual for a given screen.
Behavior in different visuals can be tested using the testgrad program in
wrlib subdirectory in distribution.
testgrad -h will show the usage.

Multidiagonal gradients are also implemented now in wrlib, and a new algorithm
is used to speed up the generation of diagonal gradients.


New arrangement of the directory structure under ~/GNUstep/
---------------------------------------------------------------

To better adapt to theme support the directory structure changed under
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker

1. Style directory moved to Styles.
2. Added the following directories: Backgrounds, IconSets, Pixmaps, Sounds and
   Themes.
3. The .style files no longer get copied in the user's Styles directory.
   Instead they are read from the global /usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Styles
   directory.

Under ~/GNUstep/Defaults the following changes occurred:

1. A default WMState is installed by wmaker.inst.
   It contains the dockit program assigned to the top icon of the dock, and
   the wmsetbg program assigned for the drop command on both dock's and clip's
   main icon.
   Double clicking the dock's main icon will bring up dockit that will let you
   dock any application that do not have an application icon.
   Dropping an image on dock's or clip's main icon, from an Offix DND aware
   application, will put the image on the background tiled, and will update
   WindowMaker domain database file.
2. Syntax of WMState changed a little. The old position will not be restored
   when you will first start the new version, but after that it will be
   normally remembered. This is because now the main clip icons is only saved
   once, not for every workspace.
   You should replace Fiend with Clip in any place where it appears, if you
   want to keep the old WMState file, else it will not work.
3. At compile time, it will detect if you have support for tif, and will
   install a WMWindowAttributes with corresponding image name extension
   (.tif or .xpm). This is true only for pixmaps that come with the source
   distribution and get installed under /usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Pixmaps

The menu file changed a lot. Old menu file will *not* work with new theme
support, so please upgrade.


New behavior of OPEN_MENU command
---------------------------------

The OPEN_MENU command now supports the following syntax:
1. File menu handling.
   // opens file.menu which must contain a valid menu file and inserts
   // it in current position
   OPEN_MENU file.menu
2. Pipe menu handling.
   // opens command and uses it's stdout to construct menu.
   // Command's output must be a valid menu description.
   OPEN_MENU | command
3. Directory handling.
   // Opens one or more directories and construct a menu with all
   // the subdirectories and executable files in them sorted alphabetically.
   OPEN_MENU /some/dir [/some/other/dir ...]
4. Directory handling with command.
   // Opens one or more directories and construct menu with all
   // subdirectories and readable files in them sorted alphabetically,
   // preceding each of them with command.
   // WITH is a required keyword!!!
   OPEN_MENU /some/dir [/some/other/dir ...] WITH command -options

Please note that because of the 'WITH' keyword old menu files no longer work
for the OPEN_MENU with a command.


Theme support
-------------

Theme support is now as easy as untar-ing a tarball in the right place.
Because of the way OPEN_MENU works, they can be installed on a global
shareable basis, or for personal user use.
Themes installed under ~/GNUstep will be available only for a user, but
if if they are installed under /usr/local/share/WindowMaker they will be seen
by all users. This is also true for style files, background images, pixmaps,
etc that get installed under /usr/local/share/WindowMaker.
Themes can be saved or loaded using the Appearance menu.

Also support for different IconSets is available. You can save or load a new
IconSet using the Appearance menu.

Setting background images is now as simple as putting the images in the right
place (~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Backgrounds or
/usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Backgrounds, or any other place in your
PixmapPath). Then use the Appearance menu. They will be instantly available
since they are opened by a OPEN_MENU command. Also the image do not need to
have a .jpg or any other extension. It will be recognized anyhow.
As an example please see the OpenStep theme supplied with WindowMaker.
The OpenStep image is a jpeg file without extension.

Please keep in mind that anything under /usr/local/share/WindowMaker will be
available for all users.


New options for wmsetbg and getstyle
------------------------------------

wmsetbg now accepts the following options:
usage: wmsetbg [-options] image
options:
 -d             dither image
 -m             match  colors
 -t             tile   image
 -s             scale  image (default)
 -u             update WindowMaker domain database
 -D <domain>    update <domain> database
 -c <cpc>       colors per channel to use

By default, it will try to guess if dithering is needed or not and proceed
accordingly.
Using -d or -m will force it to dither or match colors.

Dithering for more than 15bpp is generally not needed, and will only result
in a slower processing.
Don't use dithering except when needed, because it is slower. Else rely on
wmsetbg which will detect if dithering is needed and use it.

-u will update the WorkspaceBack in the default database domain file in
   ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker, and let WindowMaker refresh the screen.
   Please note that this option only works under WindowMaker, and will have no
   effect under other window managers, since it rely on WindowMaker to update
   the image after it reads the updated defaults database.

-D <domain> is same as above, but will update the domain <domain> instead of
   the default WindowMaker domain.

-c <cpc> will set the color per channel to use. Only needed for PseudoColor
   visuals. WindowMaker will automatically pass the value read from the
   WindowMaker domain database.


getstyle now have the -t option, that instructs it to read all options
related to theme. Without -t getstyle will read only style options that
means it will not read WorkspaceBack and IconBack.
Use -t when you want to make a theme and need all theme options to be saved.
Else it will extract just a style file.


Session management support
--------------------------

Two new commands are available for use in menus:

SAVE_SESSION and CLEAR_SESSION.

SAVE_SESSION:
will take a snapshot of all running applications, and their current hints
(shaded, hidden, minimized, geometry and workspace they are on),
and save it inside the WMState file. Also the current workspace we are on is
saved. The applications that are running and were started from dock or clip are
marked, so they will be attached to the corresponding dock/clip when restored.
This state is restored every next session, until a new one is saved or
CLEAR_SESSION is used.

CLEAR_SESSION:
will clear any previous saved session.

There is also a run time option named SaveSessionOnExit = Yes/No; that allows
one to automatically save the state of desktop when leaving WindowMaker.
This way next session, the state of the desktop before last exit is restored.

Please note that if this option is set to Yes, than any manual saving of the
state, or any clearing of the state will be overridden when exiting
WindowMaker.

These options are available under the "Workspace" menu.


User WindowMaker configuration files are now merged with global ones
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When starts WindowMaker will look for database domain files under
$GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/Defaults or ~/GNUstep/Defaults to be read. (In this order).

If they are not available then it will scan for them in
$GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT/Defaults, $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Defaults or
/usr/local/GNUstep/Defaults (in this order).

Even if the file was found or not, it will always load the corresponding domain
file under /usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Defaults.

Then if the user file was found it will merge it over the global file, else
the global file will be used.

This way any settings that are set by the system administrator in the shared
file will be available for users that do not have them in their config files.
Any option the user have in his config file will override the one in the
shared domain file.

So any new run-time options that appear in WindowMaker domain, do not need to
be set in all user files, except the ones the user wants a different behavior
from the default set for all users in the shared file.

Also it is possible for the user to not have any personal domain databases, and
the global shared ones will be used, but it still needs to have the directory
structure, so WMState gets written on session exit.
So all it needs to have is ~/GNUstep/Defaults directory available.


New behavior of the Slide Icons
-------------------------------

Animation constants are now run-time.
They are:
IconSlideDelay = 0;
IconSlideStep = 5;
IconSlideSlowDown = 50;

To better adapt both slow and fast machines the behavior of sliding icons
changed in the following manner:

Old one was to keep moving the icon with a constant step (default 5 pixels)
until it reached the destination.

Now it will use a new parameter named IconSlideSlowDown to speed up or slow
down the moving.

Instead of moving it with a constant step it will use IconSlideSlowDown to
divide the distance to the destination, and use this value as the first step.
Then is will compute the remaining distance and will again use
IconSlideSlowDown to divide it and get the new step. And so on.
When the step to move becomes smaller than IconSlideStep, IconSlideStep will
be used further until the destination is reached.

This way a nice deceleration effect is achieved, since while the icon
approaches destination, it will use smaller steps, gibing the illusion that
the icons is moving slower.

IconSlideDelay will give the pause between steps, and is expressed in ms.

Giving large values to IconSlideSlowDown (>1024 for 1024x768 screen) will
result in the old "constant step advance" behavior, since the computed step
will always be smaller than IconSlideStep, and the last will be used instead.

Making IconSlideSlowDown = 0 or 1, will result in an instant jump to the
destination without any animation.


Attribute editor
----------------

Because the icon images on screen automatically update after any change in
WMWindowAttributes domain file, the use of both Save and Apply buttons is no
longer needed. If one wants to just apply the setting to the current window
only, he will only use the Apply button.
If he wants them saved for all applications in the same instance and/or class
the using the Save button will write them to disk, and automatically
WindowMaker will update all the icons that need to be updated on screen.


Sound support
-------------

Some basic sound support is now part of WindowMaker. The sound server is not
yet part of WindowMaker distribution, so you need to download it separately.
This is because is Linux specific, and need some changes before it can be
included.
Until them if you have a Linux system and want to use sound, use the
wmsound-0.5 available at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/7874
Download that package, and only build the sound server there.
DO NO APPLY ANY PATCHES FROM THERE!, because they are already applied.
Just build the sound and copy the executable in /usr/local/bin
Follow the rest of the install steps described there, except the patch-ing
procedure.

To enable sound for WindowMaker pass --enable-sound to configure.

Also use NoSound = Yes/No; to enable/disable sound at run-time without killing
the sound server.

If you cannot set the sound to work yet, then is not for you.
Wait until the sound server will be fixed and will be part of WindowMaker.


New entries in WindowMaker domain database
------------------------------------------

The following entries have been added to the run-time options:

  SaveSessionOnExit = No;

will autosave (or not) the session state on exit.

  WindowPlaceOrigin = "64, 64";

will offset all windows in auto or cascade placement mode with the value
(in pixels) before placing them on screen. First is horizontal direction and
second is vertical.
This do not apply to windows that request a specific position on screen.
This is useful if you want your Clip on the top left corner to not be
overlapped by mapping windows.
It will let it to have a row and a column of docked appicons near the screen
edge, that will not be overlapped by windows.
If you set it to "128, 128" it will have 2 rows and 2 columns not overlapped.


  NoSound = No;

Enable/disable sound at run-time without the need of killing the sound server.


  MenuScrollDelay = 10;
  MenuScrollStep = 5;

Constants for the menu scrolling animation.

  IconSlideDelay = 0;
  IconSlideStep = 5;
  IconSlideSlowDown = 50;

Constants for the icons sliding on screen. Explained above.

  ShadeDelay = 0;
  ShadeSteps = 15;

Animation parameters for shading a window. How many steps it will take, and the
delay between steps in ms.

  DoubleClickTime = 250;

The time for the double click to be considered so. Expressed in ms.

  SClipColor = "#6f8ae2";

Color for selected icons in Clip.

All delays are expressed in ms.



--- 0.14.1


*** Enhanced fiend clone.

Here are the new fiend features:
1. Keys for raising/lowering the fiend, and their default values:
   FiendLowerKey = None;
   FiendRaiseKey = None;
   FiendRaiseLowerKey = None;

   All reside in WindowMaker configuration file.

2. Added possibility to launch the workspace menu with button1 click on the
   idle indicator of fiend, or with button3 click on workspace name on the
   fiend.

3. Added Control-button1-click on fiend's idle indicator, to create a new
   workspace and move to it. Same action as New item in Workspace menu.

4. Fiend's idle indicator do have a color that reflects its normal/collapsed
   state.

5. The delay between changing workspaces from fiend is now a run-time option:

   WorkspaceChangeDelay = 700;

   in WindowMaker configuration file.

6. Application icons can be moved between dock and fiend now.

7. The way workspaces are changed is controlled now by two run-time options:

   AdvanceToNewWorkspace=Yes/No;
   CycleWorkspaces=Yes/No;

   Both apply to either fiend navigating buttons or to next/prev workspace
   keybindings. Both default to No, and are in WindowMaker configuration file.

8. Also added possibility to advance to new workspace, no matter what value
   AdvanceToNewWorkspace have, with Control-button1-click on "next workspace"
   fiend button.


*** Theme support ***

Spixmap and tpixmap now work. Their syntax is:

SomeStyleOption = (spixmap, file, color);
SomeStyleOption = (tpixmap, file, color);

- spixmap means scaled pixmap, so the image in the file will be scaled to
adapt to the destination's size.
- tpixmap means tiled pixmap, and the image from file will be tiled in the
destination.

file is searched in the PixmapPath, but can be a full path name.

Color is used depending on which Style option is applied.
For example in case of titlebars, color is used for miniwindows titles color.
You are not restricted in selecting that color, but is better to put one
that matches the overall color of the image.

Currently they apply to all the options that accept (solid, color), or any
type of gradient.
This means they also apply to WorkspaceBack and IconBack, which allows theme
support with the simple use of the setstyle and getstyle utilities.
There is no need for an extra theme manager, just to include the needed
options in the style files.

In case of WorkspaceBack, color is used to be set in the background until
the image gets loaded and displayed. This is to avoid the stippled screen
the X server shows, in case the image is big and loads slow.
There is a small utility in the util directory, named wmsetbg which is
used to set the background image. This is needed for WindowMaker not to
freeze while loading and scaling the image.
Currently it is hardcoded in WindowMaker to use wmsetbg to set the background
image, and is better to use it since is smaller that other image manipulation
programs, and it is compiled with support for same image types as WindowMaker.
Since it comes and is installed with WindowMaker, there will be no need to
download and use an external app, which also may not have support for the same
image types as WindowMaker.



--- 0.14.0

*** Fiend clone.

The fiend clone is a dock extender, that lets you dock more than the default
10-12 icons in the dock. It actually lets you dock how many icons you like,
with a current default of 25 per workspace. The fiend have different docked
icons on every workspace. Also the fiend main icon shows you the workspace
you're on and lets you navigate through the workspaces with the small green
buttons on the low right corner.
To save screen space the fiend can be collapsed to the main icon either
from the fiend menu (available with right click on the fiend icons), or
with a double left click on the main fiend icon, which is a toggle for
the collapsed/uncollapsed state.
Collapsed state is marked by a different title color.
Pressing on the small buttons on the low right corner, the workspaces are
changed in increments of 1 to the left or right, but keeping the button
pressed over them will continuously advance through workspaces until the
mouse is moved away from the buttons or the button is released.
The delay between workspace changes is set by FIEND_WKS_CHANGE_DELAY in
src/wconfig.h, and defaults to 700 ms.
Unlike the dock, fiend can hold icons in any directions, and can be placed
in any position on screen.

When an icons is to be docked, but the position can be either in the dock
or in the fiend, the dock will be used first, and the icon will be docked
there.

Here are the new run-time options introduced by the fiend:
Files are located in ~/GNUstep/Defaults/

In WMWindowAttributes:
       "Logo.WMFiend" = {Icon = "Cone.xpm";};  - icon for the fiend

In WindowMaker:
	FiendMaxIcons = 25;           - the max number of icons in fiend per
        				workspace
	FiendTitleFont = "-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*";
				      - the font used to show the current
                                        workspace
	FiendTitleColor = black;      - color for the uncollapsed fiend title
	CFiendTitleColor = "#616161"; - color for the collapsed fiend title
	AFiendColor = "#00ba70";      - color for the workspace changing
        				buttons, when active
	IFiendColor = "#008000";      - color for the workspace changing
        				buttons, when idle

For the ones who don't want to use fiend, there is a option to wmaker named
-nofiend that can be feed to the command line when starting wmaker.
(This is the equivalent for -nodock, but removes fiend clone).

The syntax of WMState file have changed, but you don't have to worry because
WindowMaker will know to read the old format and will save it and further
will use the new one. You do not need to change your file, for the new version
to work.


--- 0.13.1

*** Enhanced Attribute editor.

Now you can save defaults for all windows.
Please note that only Icon, KeepInsideScreen, and sometimes NoAppIcon
can be useful in a normal environment. But others may have other opinion ;)
If you set AlwaysUserIcon default for all windows, note that apps like
asclock, wmload, wmmail, wmrack, will show that icon instead of their
window.

Now Attribute editor also counts for defaults saved for all windows,
(not only the default "No" for all options hardcoded in WindowMaker),
when saving options for some instance.class specification. This is to
save disk space by saving only the options that differs from global defaults
(either defaults for all windows or the hardcoded valued in WindowMaker).

Attribute Editor now updates on the fly the appicon image or creates/deletes
the appicon if you set that options in the Inspector panel and Apply them.
Modifying Icon file, NoAppIcon or AlwaysUserIcon and Applying them will
result in the image update for the app-icon.

Note that if you apply but not save these options, the miniwindow image will
not be updated. This is because app-icon is always on screen so it can be
updated, but miniwindow image is read from the defaults database and from disk
every time you minimize the window and is destroyed when you restore.


--- 0.13.0

*** Attribute editor is working ;).

How it works is quite obvious.
Anyway, here is a short description.

Save   - only save the configuration in defaults database and updates
         WMWindowAttributes
Apply  - only applies the values to the current window
Revert - reverts the values from the defaults database

Note that Save and Revert count for the window specification
(instance & class), that are selected, and save/use the values for/from
that.

 The Update button will show the icon who's name was typed in the textfield
If the textfield is empty, will try to use the default icon.
Also saving with and empty textfield for icon, uses the default icon.

 The Default button will use the icon in the textfield as default icon
and save that value in WMWindowAttributes (Note that in this case is no
need to press the Save button!). Also if the textfield is empty it will
try to use the old default icon, if available.

*** Now menus are saved between sessions, or over a restart.

 Just stick them to the desktop, and you will find them over sessions
until you close them.
 Please note that only the root_menu, the window switch_menu and the
workspaces_menu can be saved this way.

*** Changed the lousy Windoze menu behavior.

This applies to 'NextMenuBehaviour = NO;'

 Now the items are no more automatically selected if you launch the menu
and the mouse is over some item, if you use a short click to launch the
menu (shorter than the default DBL click time).
 If you use a longer click or keep the mouse pressed, the item under mouse
will be selected after that delay, and launched when you will release the
mouse button.
 If the click was short, a second one is needed to launch the item.

*** Auto-arrange icons is now a run-time option

Use
AutoArrangeIcons = YES/NO;
in 'WindowMaker'.

*** Added configurable horizontal resize threshold

Use
  HorizontalResizeThreshold = <n>;

This will make the n pixels at the exterior side of the corner handle
of the resize bar to restrict to horizontal only resize.
Also you can use Shift-click&drag anywhere on the corner handle to
restrict the resize only to horizontal.
Note that the Shift-click&drag does not depend of the configured threshold
and works completely independent.

*** New option for OPEN_MENU (pipe from command)

OPEN_MENU | /foo/bar/script

will make a menu that is dynamically constructed by /foo/bar/script


--- 0.12.0

*** New option for OPEN_MENU

OPEN_MENU /foo/bar/pics xv -root -quit

will make a menu with all files in /foo/bar/pics and precede them
with EXEC xv -root -quit

thus, making a menu with entries like:


"marble.gif" EXEC xv -root -quit marble.gif
"water.jpg" EXEC xv -root -quit water.jpg
...


*** Multicolor gradients

(mhgradient, colorX, color1, color2, color3, ..., colorn)
(mvgradient, colorX, color1, color2, color3, ..., colorn)

You can put any number of colors >= 2. 

colorX is a special color that is used as the solid color of the
texture when wmaker needs a solid color (like in miniwindow title and
resizebar)

*** PixmapPath format changed

What used to be

PixmapPath = "/usr/local/share/pixmaps:~/foobar";

must now be

PixmapPath = ("/usr/local/share/pixmaps", "~/foobar");


*** Added OffiX DND in dock

Use the "Set drop arguments..." command in the menu and put a %d
where the dropped object string should be substituted, like:

xedit %d

*** Escape thingies for menu and dock commands:

%w - substitute with current selected X window ID
%s - substitute with current selection
%d - substitute with last dropped object
%a(some text) - opens a input box with "some text" as a title. Then,
the text typed will be substituted there

\r, \n - substitute with corresponding characters


*** The WMState file format has changed a little.
The Command field for the dock application list is now a normal string,
instead of a list. So, remove the parentheses and the commas for the command
and join all the parts. Example:

if it used to be

Command = ( xterm," -geometry", "+10+10" );

then make it

Command = "xterm -geometry +10+10";


--- 0.10.2

AutoFocus = NO; disables automatic focusing of windows
when they are first mapped


--- 0.10.1

titlebar gradients are in a single piece now

the WMDock file was merged into the WMState file. You can insert this
file in WMState and set it's key to Dock. For example, if your WMDock
contains:

{
	Applications = { {Command = (); }};
	Position = "-64,0";
	Lowered = NO;
}

and WMState contains:

{
	Workspaces = ( "Workspace 1" );
}

then you can merge both and have:

{
	Workspaces = ( "Workspace 1" );
	Dock = {
        	Applications = { {Command = (); }};
        	Position = "-64,0";
       	 	Lowered = NO;
	};
}



The configuration format has changed!! Forget everything about the old
format.

dockapp was removed and the old version will not work anymore. 

the dialogs require tcl/tk. they will be rewritten in plain C


These are some tips for people upgrading from older versions and don't want
too many unused files around. There is no problem if you decide to keep 
them for a while.

	you can  rm -r ~/gnustep if you don't want anything from there

	remove the files in /usr/local/share/WindowMaker before installation

	the /usr/local/share/pixmaps directory can be removed
