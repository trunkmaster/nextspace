Changes since version 0.92.0:
.............................

- added check for --with-gnustepdir option to configure to verify that its
  argument is an absolute path
- updated german translations (Torsten Marek <shlomme@gmx.net>)
- fixed WPrefs.app to find its icons when not installed under GNUstep paths
- fixed gcc-4 compilation issues (Vladimir Nadvornik <nadvornik@suse.cz>)
- fixed amd64 compilation issues (Vladimir Nadvornik <nadvornik@suse.cz>)

  Window Maker (Martin Frydl <martin.frydl@systinet.com>)
- fixed a small memory leak in WINGs/wview.c caused by not releasing the
  background color of a view (Martin Frydl <martin.frydl@systinet.com>)
- updated estonian translation (Ivar Smolin <okul@linux.ee>)
- updated the XDND code in WINGs to work with GDK based applications.
  WINGs based applications should now work with both KDE and GNOME
  applications (Sylvain Reynal <sreynal@nerim.net>)
- better check for the XDND protocol version when interoperating with other
  applications. As it seems xdnd version 3 (which WINGs supports) and newer
  are not backward compatible with xdnd version 1 and 2. This is why WINGs
  applications cannot interoperate with GNUstep applications (which uses
  xdnd version 2). Xdnd version 4 and 5 are backwards compatible with
  version 3 though. (Sylvain Reynal <sreynal@nerim.net>)
- Improved Info panel layout and fonts.
- Fixed missing library paths when linking some binaries on certain
  platforms with a recent pkg-config (debian unstable/sid for one)

  on the filesystem for different systems/distributions.
- Fixed segfault when unhiding an application in certain conditions (seen
  with KDE applications with transient windows)


Changes since version 0.91.0:
.............................

- fixed crash with info panel and alt-tabbing
- updated Japanese translations (Takeo Hashimoto <HashimotoTakeo@mac.com>)

- added X Input Methods support in WINGs
- fixed issues with compiling on Solaris with openwin
- reduced minimum required version number for the Xft library to 2.1.0
- fixed some compilation issues with gcc-2.9x
- removed --with-appsdir option and replaced it with --with-gnustepdir. Also,
  default installation path (for non GNUstep users) is now $(prefix)/bin
- fixed bug with infinite loop in some circumstances in fitText() in WINGs
- fixed to allow parallel builds on SMP systems using make -j
- updated Italian translation (Marco Colombo <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>)
- applied .AppInfo --> Library path rename patch (Alex Perez <aperez@student.santarosa.edu>)
- added code to automatically update the icon paths from the old .AppInfo
  style to the new Library/WindowMaker style in WMWindowAttributes when
  Window Maker starts to make transition transparent for users.
- fixed issue with window being moved by 1 pixel up and left when the window
  move was initiated by the client
- improved hide/unhide animation for applications with multiple windows
  (only animate the active window hiding/unhiding, which makes Window Maker
  faster and more responsive for such applications). This also makes the
  restart operation much faster.
- fixed bug with windows shrinking to very small sizes when Unmaximize was
  used on them, after they were closed in a maximized state.
- fixed bug with restoring maximized state from NetWM atoms.
- fixed issue with GNUstep applications losing focus when all their windows
  are closed and there remains only their menu (Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>)
- try fixed font for the technical drawing font if helvetica-12 is not
  available to avoid crashing (Timo Juhani Lindfors <timo.lindfors@iki.fi>)
- new algorithm for placing miniwindows after unhiding the application they
  belong to, that works without auto-arranging the icons, while still avoiding
  multiple icons in the same spot by moving the miniwindows to a new slot if
  their old slot was occupied in the meantime.
- double clicking an appicon will also raise the miniwindows that belong to
  that application to the front (along with the normal windows).


Changes since version 0.90.0:
.............................

- added _NET_WM_NAME, _NET_WM_ICON_NAME and _NET_WM_ICON to WINGs

  transparency. Details in WINGs/ChangeLog.

- Fixed incorrect focusing of application's windows after an unhide (sometimes
  the incorrect window got focus instead of the apps's last focused window)

  (this is to be consistent with deminiaturizing application's miniwindows
  which also happens in this case, since shading is a form of miniaturization)
- Fixed bug with tpixmap from previous xinerama patch (reported by g0sh)
- Fixed edge resistance and move/resize frame drawing for borderless windows
- Fixed wrong display position for the move/resize widgets after xinerama
  patch (Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>)
- Fixed bug with cursor locked in drag mode after Alt-dragging a window
- Added Catalan translation (Ernest Adrogu <eadrogue@gmx.net>)
- Fixed a bug with deminiaturizing windows when the application is hidden and
  the miniaturized window is selected from the window list menu
- Fixed a bug with not showing shaded window frames when the application is
  hidden and another window belonging to the app is selected in the window
  list menu

  Eduardo Pereira Habkost <ehabkost@conectiva.com.br>
- Fixed a bug that crashed wmaker when selecting the "Start alternate window 
  manager" option in the crashing dialog panel.

  it is defined) to overwrite the default hardcoded fallback window manager.
- Fixed marks for menu entries to be grayed as the text for disabled entries.
- Fixed Clip's "Autoraise" option to be marked as disabled when the

Changes since version 0.70.0:
.............................

- Disabled window birth animation by default (while it was ok with normal 
  windows, it was very annoying with menus editing in WPrefs.app)
- Added ability to shade/unshade a window using the mouse wheel.
- Fixed compilation for systems that required -lintl for WINGs
  (Jim Knoble <jmknoble@pobox.com>)
- Removed redundant include/lib paths from the get-*-flags scripts
- Updated slovak .po files (Jan Tomka <judas@linux.sk>)
- Added "Save workspace state" switch button on the exit confirmation panel

  (Alexey Voinov <voins@voins.program.ru>)
- Added patch to fix some gnome issues (Les Schaffer <schaffer@optonline.net>)
- SIGTERM is now handled and saves the internal state before exiting (like
  SIGHUP and SIGINT already do). Now a "kill wmaker_pid" will exit cleanly
  saving dock/clip/session information on exit.
- Added an internal strcasecmp() to WINGs (only on systems where's not present)
- Deminiaturizing a window that is also shaded, will perform an unshade too.
  (Note that this only applies to deminiaturizing shaded windows. Unhiding 
  an application will keep the shaded/unshaded state of windows.)
- Removed compile time option for definable cursors and made them available by
  default.
- Mapping a new window that belongs to a running application that is hidden,
  will unhide the application.
- Added || pipe menu for generating non-cached menus
- Removed the collapse appicons thing.
- Added real appicon sharing (apps of the same kind will have a single shared 
  appicon).
- Fixed user and global defaults domain merging to preserve values present in
  global but not in user, in sub-dictionaries.
- Made dock/clip steal appicons of applications that were started from a
  shell/xterm or from the main menu, if there is a docked appicon of that
  class that is not running at the time the app is launched.
- Added animation to show that the appicon was stolen by the dock (the way
  NEXTSTEP did - map an appicon as it normally would have been, then slide it
  to the position the docked appicon is).
- Updated the animation constants for scrolling/sliding/shading to better
  adapt to newer/faster machines. Also used wusleep(10) when the delay was 0
  to get rid of the jerky animation when there was no delay.
- Fixed bug with Unhide mapping windows from other workspaces.
- keyboard shortcuts are active during mouse window drag
- Saving a domain file will first strip all entries that are also present in
  the global domain as well and are exactly the same. This fixes a bug where
  settings from the global domain file were merged in the user domain file
  and further changes in the global domain file for those merged values was
  ignored making a system admin unable to set global defaults for all users
  using the global domains.
- Fixed bug with improper setting of root/titlebar cursor (definable cursors).

Changes since version 0.65.1:

- internal code clean-up with notifications for window state change and other
  stuff
- removed the libPropList dependancy by adding property list handling
  code to WINGs. This code is not only better integrated with the other
  WINGs data structures, but it's also more robust. Also a backward
  compatibility header file is provided which maps old libPropList
  function names to the new WINGs based proplist names allowing old code
  to be linked to WINGs with minimal changes. For details on how to use
  the compat mode, read the comments on top of WINGs/WINGs/proplist-compat.h
  More details about this can be found in WINGs/ChangeLog and WINGs/NEWS.

  wrong if it had alpha blending.
- Removed the following 3 options from configuration: SelectWindowsMouseButton,
  WindowListMouseButton and ApplicationMenuMouseButton.
- Added 4 options to the configuration file for binding workspace actions to
  mouse buttons: MouseLeftButtonAction, MouseMiddleButtonAction,
  MouseRightButtonAction and MouseWheelAction. They replace the above 3
  removed options, but use a different semantic. More in NEWS.
- client supplied icons that were saved by Window Maker in the directory

Changes since version 0.15.0:
.............................

- Fixed bug that kept an appicon selected after detaching.
- Fixed bug that crashed WindowMaker if starting an application with.
  NoAppIcon = Yes; while AutoArrangeIcons = True;
- Fixed the installed .xinitrc file.
- Fixed some ANSI C incompatibilities.
- Applications with omnipresent flag set will be mapped on the current
  workspace, no matter from which Workspace Dock they were started from.
- mkmenu no longer gets installed, since is no longer needed.
- Fixed a problem for systems which do bad things for free(NULL);
- Attracted icons in Clip will not be saved in WMState if
  "Keep Attracted Icons" is not set.
- Fixed code in defaults.c to use default hard coded values, if a syntax error
  is encountered when parsing the default domain WindowMaker database.
  This avoids a crashing bug if an image for spixmap or tpixmap is not found.
- Fixed some missing parameter in a call to wWarning() in texture.c which could
  have caused hazardous (even crash) behavior if the pixmap image for texture
  was not found.
- Fixed code in session handling, to save only one entry for applications with
  multiple windows opened on screen.
- Implemented option to allow miniwindows to be workspace specific. It is named
  WorkspaceTiedMiniWindows = Yes/No; It is set in WindowMaker domain. Read NEWS
- Fixed bug with incorrect height restoral of window when unshading requested
  from client.
- Fixed problem with solid IconBack.
- Fixed problem with hardcoded /usr/local. The value given to configure with
  --prefix=/some/path is now used.

  WM_STATE hint set before the window is mapped.
- Changed how the bevel for the menu title is drawn for solid color titlebars.
  They now look nicer, and more consistent with the rest.
- Implemented a new animation method when blowing the detached icons. See NEWS.
- Fixed some places in code where hardcoded values (8) were used instead of
  TITLEBAR_EXTRA_HEIGHT.
- Implemented a marking for the HorizontalResizeThreshold option. It will mark
  the corresponding number of pixels on the resizebar corner if the option
  is greater than 0.
- Changed WindowPlaceOrigin format from string to array. It should now be:
  WindowPlaceOrigin = (64, 64); Default is (0, 0).
- The geometry window is now constrained to be always visible on screen, if
  the geometry is set to be displayed Floating.
- The geometry window size is decided based on the font size. Also the geometry
  window is correctly updated if the font size is changed while running.
- Deleted unnecessary redrawing code in moveres.c.
- Many fixes to moveres.c.
- Put all the keys from defaults.c in WindowMaker domain database. 
- Fixed a crashing bug when workspace names were as long (or longer) as
  MAX_WORKSPACENAME_WIDTH (16 characters). In this case a right click on a
  window title caused WindowMaker to crash.
- Included support for detecting if system requires to include libxpg4, which
  is needed by some FreeBSD systems, when using --enable-kanji.
- Some fixes to configure.in and some Makefile.am files to allow the use of
  VPATH feature of 'make', which will let the source and build directories to
  be separate.
- Changed the application launching code, so it put fork()-ed processes in
  process groups of their own, to avoid locking of entire session, due to a
  badly configure launching child. Only for systems which have setpgrp().
  This is autodetected by configure, and used if available, else it will revert
  to old behavior.
- Added the AutoCollapse feature to clip. This (when set) will allow the clip
  to stay collapsed, and show when moving the mouse over it. When the mouse
  leaves it, it will collapse back after a delay. Read NEWS.

  with click on title-bar. Meta click on titlebar will lower them.
- Fixes in moveres.c to allow a smoother draw of frames while moving and
  resizing windows.
- Fixed a problem when resizing with Meta+RightClick.
- Fixed a bug that freezed WindowMaker when dragging a window from one
