USAGE                                                      *bufexplorer-usage*

To start exploring in the current window, use: >
 \be  or  :BufExplorer
To start exploring in a newly split window, use: >
 \bs  or  :SBufExplorer
To start exploring in a newly (forced) vertical split window, use: >
 \bv  or  :VSBufExplorer

Note: If the current buffer is modified, the current window is always
      split.

Command to use once exploring:

 <F1>          Toggle help information.
 <cr> or       Opens the buffer that is under the cursor into the current
 <leftmouse>   window.
 S             Opens the buffer that is under the cursor into a newly split
               window.
 d             Deletes the buffer from the list that is under the cursor.
 o             Toggles open mode. Only available in 'split mode'.
 p             Toggles the showing of a split filename/pathname.
 q             Quit exploring.
 r             Reverses the order the buffers are listed in.
 R             Toggles relative path/absolute path.
 s             Selects the order the buffers are listed in. Either by buffer
               number, file name, file extension, most recently used (MRU), or
               full path.
 t             Toggles split type. Only available in 'split mode'.

Typically one would put bufexplorer.vim into the .vim/plugin directory
(vimfiles\plugin for Windows) where it becomes automatically available
for use. It sets up it's default keymaps to use \be and \bs. If you would
like to use something other than '\', you may simply change the leader
(see |mapleader|).

Once invoked, Buffer Explorer displays a sorted list (MRU is the default
sort method) of all the buffers that are currently opened. You are then
able to move the cursor to the line containing the buffer's name you are
wanting to act upon. Once you have selected the buffer you would like,
you can then either open it, close it(delete), resort the list, reverse
the sort, quit exploring and so on...

You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_bufexplorer"
variable: >
  :let loaded_bufexplorer = 1

CHANGE LOG                                              *bufexplorer-changelog*

7.0.15 - Thanks to Mark Smithfield for suggesting bufexplorer needed to handle
         the ':args' command.
         Fixed issue reported by Liu Jiaping on non Windows systems, which was
         ...
         Open file1, open file2, modify file1, open bufexplorer, you get the
         following error:

         --------8<--------
         Error detected while processing function
         <SNR>14_StartBufExplorer..<SNR>14_SplitOpen:
         line    4:
         E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)

         But the worse thing is, when I want to save the current buffer and
         type ':w', I get another error message:
         E382: Cannot write, 'buftype' option is set 
         --------8<--------
7.0.14 - Thanks to Randall Hansen for removing the requirement of terminal
         versions to be recompiled with 'gui' support so the 'drop' command
         would work. The 'drop' command is really not needed in terminal
         versions.
7.0.13 - Fixed integration with WinManager.
         Thanks to Dave Eggum for another update.
           - Fix: The detailed help didn't display the mapping for toggling
                  the split type, even though the split type is displayed.
           - Fixed incorrect description in the detailed help for toggling
             relative or full paths.
           - Deprecated s:ExtractBufferNbr(). Vim's str2nr() does the same
             thing.
           - Created a s:Set() function that sets a variable only if it hasn't
             already been defined. It's useful for initializing all those
             default settings.
           - Removed checks for repetitive command definitions. They were
             unnecessary.
           - Made the help highlighting a little more fancy.
           - Minor reverse compatibility issue: Changed ambiguous setting
             names to be more descriptive of what they do (also makes the code
             easier to follow):
               Changed bufExplorerSortDirection to bufExplorerReverseSort
               Changed bufExplorerSplitType to bufExplorerSplitVertical
               Changed bufExplorerOpenMode to bufExplorerUseCurrentWindow
           - When the BufExplorer window closes, all the file-local marks are
             now deleted. This may have the benefit of cleaning up some of the
             jumplist.
           - Changed the name of the parameter for StartBufExplorer from
             "split" to "open". The parameter is a string which specifies how
             the buffer will be open, not if it is split or not.
           - Deprecated DoAnyMoreBuffersExist() - it is a one line function
             only used in one spot.
           - Created four functions (SplitOpen(), RebuildBufferList(),
             UpdateHelpStatus() and ReSortListing()) all with one purpose - to
             reduce repeated code.
           - Changed the name of AddHeader() to CreateHelp() to be more
             descriptive of what it does. It now returns an array instead of
             updating the window directly. This has the benefit of making the
             code more efficient since the text the function returns is used a
             little differently in the two places the function is called.
         - Other minor simplifications.
7.0.12 - MAJOR Update.
         This version will ONLY run with Vim version 7.0 or greater.
         Dave Eggum has made some 'significant' updates to this latest
         version:
           - Added BufExplorerGetAltBuf() global function to be used in the
             user’s rulerformat.
           - Added g:bufExplorerSplitRight option.
           - Added g:bufExplorerShowRelativePath option with mapping.
           - Added current line highlighting.
           - The split type can now be changed whether bufexplorer is opened
             in split mode or not.
           - Various major and minor bug fixes and speed improvements.
           - Sort by extension.
         Other improvements/changes:
           - Changed the help key from '?' to <F1> to be more 'standard'.
           - Fixed splitting of vertical bufexplorer window.
         Hopefully I have not forgot something :)
7.0.11 - Fixed a couple of highlighting bugs, reported by David Eggum. He also
         changed passive voice to active on a couple of warning messages.
7.0.10 - Fixed bug report by Xiangjiang Ma. If the 'ssl' option is set,
         the slash character used when displaying the path was incorrect.
7.0.9  - Martin Grenfell found and eliminated an annoying bug in the
         bufexplorer/winmanager integration. The bug was were an
         annoying message would be displayed when a window was split or
         a new file was opened in a new window. Thanks Martin!
7.0.8  - Thanks to Mike Li for catching a bug in the WinManager integration.
         The bug was related to the incorrect displaying of the buffer
         explorer's window title.
7.0.7  - Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar for adding a new enhancement. This
         enhancement allows the user to press 'S', that is capital S, which
         will open the buffer under the cursor in a newly created split
         window.
7.0.6  - Thanks to Larry Zhang for finding a bug in the "split" buffer code.
         If you force set g:bufExplorerSplitType='v' in your vimrc, and if you
         tried to do a \bs to split the bufexplorer window, it would always
         split horizontal, not vertical. He also found that I had a typeo in
         that the variable g:bufExplorerSplitVertSize was all lower case in
         the documentation which was incorrect.
7.0.5  - Thanks to Mun Johl for pointing out a bug that if a buffer was
         modified, the '+' was not showing up correctly.
7.0.4  - Fixed a problem discovered first by Xiangjiang Ma. Well since I've
         been using vim 7.0 and not 6.3, I started using a function (getftype)
         that is not in 6.3. So for backward compatibility, I conditionaly use
         this function now.  Thus, the g:bufExplorerShowDirectories feature is
         only available when using vim 7.0 and above.
7.0.3  - Thanks to Erwin Waterlander for finding a problem when the last
         buffer was deleted. This issue got me to rewrite the buffer display
         logic (which I've wanted to do for sometime now).
         Also great thanks to Dave Eggum for coming up with idea for
         g:bufExplorerShowDirectories. Read the above information about this
         feature.
7.0.2  - Thanks to Thomas Arendsen Hein for finding a problem when a user
         has the default help turned off and then brought up the explorer. An
         E493 would be displayed.
7.0.1  - Thanks to Erwin Waterlander for finding a couple problems.
         The first problem allowed a modified buffer to be deleted.  Opps! The
         second problem occurred when several files were opened, BufExplorer
         was started, the current buffer was deleted using the 'd' option, and
         then BufExplorer was exited. The deleted buffer was still visible
         while it is not in the buffers list. Opps again!
7.0.0  - Thanks to Shankar R. for suggesting to add the ability to set
         the fixed width (g:bufExplorerSplitVertSize) of a new window
         when opening bufexplorer vertically and fixed height
         (g:bufExplorerSplitHorzSize) of a new window when opening
         bufexplorer horizontally. By default, the windows are normally
         split to use half the existing width or height.
6.3.0  - Added keepjumps so that the jumps list would not get cluttered with
         bufexplorer related stuff.
6.2.3  - Thanks to Jay Logan for finding a bug in the vertical split position
         of the code. When selecting that the window was to be split
         vertically by doing a '\bv', from then on, all splits, i.e. '\bs',
         were split vertically, even though g:bufExplorerSplitType was not set
         to 'v'.
6.2.2  - Thanks to Patrik Modesto for adding a small improvement. For some
         reason his bufexplorer window was always showing up folded. He added
         'setlocal nofoldenable' and it was fixed.
6.2.1  - Thanks goes out to Takashi Matsuo for added the 'fullPath' sorting
         logic and option.
6.2.0  - Thanks goes out to Simon Johann-Ganter for spotting and fixing a
         problem in that the last search pattern is overridden by the search
         pattern for blank lines.
6.1.6  - Thanks to Artem Chuprina for finding a pesky bug that has been around
         for sometime now. The <esc> key mapping was causing the buffer
         explored to close prematurely when vim was run in an xterm. The <esc>
         key mapping is now removed.
6.1.5  - Thanks to Khorev Sergey. Added option to show default help or not.
6.1.4  - Thanks goes out to Valery Kondakoff for suggesting the addition of
         setlocal nonumber and foldcolumn=0. This allows for line numbering
         and folding to be turned off temporarily while in the explorer.
6.1.3  - Added folding. Did some code cleanup. Added the ability to force the
         newly split window to be temporarily vertical, which was suggested by
         Thomas Glanzmann.
6.1.2  - Now pressing the <esc> key will quit, just like 'q'.
         Added folds to hide winmanager configuration.
         If anyone had the 'C' option in their cpoptions they would receive
         a E10 error on startup of BufExplorer. cpo is now saved, updated and
         restored. Thanks to Charles E Campbell, Jr.
         Attempted to make sure there can only be one BufExplorer window open
         at a time.
6.1.1  - Thanks to Brian D. Goodwin for adding toupper to FileNameCmp. This
         way buffers sorted by name will be in the correct order regardless of
         case.
6.0.16 - Thanks to Andre Pang for the original patch/idea to get bufexplorer
         to work in insertmode/modeless mode (evim). Added Initialize
         and Cleanup autocommands to handle commands that need to be
         performed when starting or leaving bufexplorer.
6.0.15 - Srinath Avadhanulax added a patch for winmanager.vim.
6.0.14 - Fix a few more bug that I thought I already had fixed. Thanks
         to Eric Bloodworth for adding 'Open Mode/Edit in Place'. Added
         vertical splitting.
6.0.13 - Thanks to Charles E Campbell, Jr. for pointing out some embarrassing
         typos that I had in the documentation. I guess I need to run
         the spell checker more :o)
6.0.12 - Thanks to Madoka Machitani, for the tip on adding the augroup command
         around the MRUList autocommands.
6.0.11 - Fixed bug report by Xiangjiang Ma. '"=' was being added to the
         search history which messed up hlsearch.
6.0.10 - Added the necessary hooks so that the Srinath Avadhanula's
         winmanager.vim script could more easily integrate with this script.
         Tried to improve performance.
6.0.9  - Added MRU (Most Recently Used) sort ordering.
6.0.8  - Was not resetting the showcmd command correctly.
         Added nifty help file.
6.0.7  - Thanks to Brett Carlane for some great enhancements. Some are added,
         some are not, yet. Added highlighting of current and alternate
         filenames. Added splitting of path/filename toggle. Reworked
         ShowBuffers().
         Changed my email address.
6.0.6  - Copyright notice added. Needed this so that it could be distributed
         with Debian Linux. Fixed problem with the SortListing() function
         failing when there was only one buffer to display.
6.0.5  - Fixed problems reported by David Pascoe, in that you where unable to
         hit 'd' on a buffer that belonged to a files that no longer existed
         and that the 'yank' buffer was being overridden by the help text when
         the bufexplorer was opened.
6.0.4  - Thanks to Charles Campbell, Jr. for making this plugin more plugin
         *compliant*, adding default keymappings of <Leader>be and <Leader>bs
         as well as fixing the 'w:sortDirLabel not being defined' bug.
6.0.3  - Added sorting capabilities. Sort taken from explorer.vim.
6.0.2  - Can't remember.
6.0.1  - Initial release.
